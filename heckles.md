I can appreciate a good heckle towards a match offical. It's a good way to make a point indirectly and with humor. A good heckle can't be too complex (as if it is not understood it has no effect) or too simple/common (as it comes across as complaining or petty). A good rule is that the average person who has not heard the heckle before should figure it out in three to ten seconds. A good heckle should never demean someone or use profanity.
