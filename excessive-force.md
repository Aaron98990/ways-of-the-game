The Laws of the Game designates three levels of physical severity for misconduct - careless, reckless, and excessive force. This wording is important - especially in match reports.

> Careless is when a player shows a lack of attention or consideration when making a challenge or acts without precaution. No disciplinary sanction is needed
> 
> Reckless is when a player acts with disregard to the danger to, or consequences for, an opponent and must be cautioned
> 
> Using excessive force is when a player exceeds the necessary use of force and/or endangers the safety of an opponent and must be sent off
>
> Law 12.1 Direct Free Kicks

The level of physical severity does not depend on:
- intention (deliberate or accidental)
- the score (blowout or close)
- play not being stopped for advantage (including if the non-offending team scores)
- the number of fouls commited before (including if it's a player, team, or the match's first foul)

> Serious foul play
> 
> A tackle or challenge that endangers the safety of an opponent or uses excessive force or brutality must be sanctioned as serious foul play.
> 
> Any player who lunges at an opponent in challenging for the ball from the front, from the side or from behind using one or both legs, with excessive force or endangers the safety of an opponent is guilty of serious foul play.

> Violent conduct
> 
> Violent conduct is when a player uses or attempts to use excessive force or brutality against an opponent when not challenging for the ball, or against a team-mate, team official, match official, spectator or any other person, regardless of whether contact is made.
> 
> In addition, a player who, when not challenging for the ball, deliberately strikes an opponent or any other person on the head or face with the hand or arm, is guilty of violent conduct unless the force used was negligible.

A player can be found to be using excessive force even if there is no or minimal contact made with the other person or the other person pulls out/avoids the situation.

Both serious foul play and violent conduct are both send-off offenses for using excessive force. It is impossible for an offense to be serious foul play and violent conduct at the same time. It can only be one. 

It is serious foul play if:
- a challenge is being made for the ball and
- the offense is against an opponent 

This distinction matters as competitions generally will suspend players for more games for violent conduct than serious foul play. There is also "biting or spitting at someone" as a send-off offense which should be used rather than violent conduct when it applies as competitions generally will suspend the person even more games.

## Strikes at

Striking with the hand/arm is one of the most serious offenses in the game (elbowing, punching, slapping, clotheslining, stamping someone's face to the ground, choking, eye poking, lifting someone, throwing someone to the ground/body slam, hair pulling) There is a great write up from PRO about challenging with the hands/arms [here](https://proreferees.com/2020/04/20/pro-insight-tool-or-weapon-challenging-with-hands-arms/).

Clotheslining is having an opponent's momentum running into your straight arm at the neck, head, or upper-chest level mimicking the action of running into a low hanging [clothesline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothes_line). The opponent will fall with the head back and feet first. It is so dangerous it is a send-off in [Canadian football](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiNmQZWeaU8&ab_channel=DavidMcLennan) and [rugby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he6S8mtSgxE&ab_channel=mohblind).

Deliberate hair pulling has no part in soccer. It is always violent conduct even with minimal force.

If someone deliberately strikes the ball at someone (by throwing or kicking it) with high intensity or at the face or neck with any intensity, it is violent conduct. If it does not rise to violent conduct and is foul, it is generally reckless. A player can deliberately strike the ball at an opponent when the ball is in play, if not reckless, careless, or using excessive force. PRO has a write up about kicking the ball at someone [here](https://proreferees.com/2021/06/10/pro-insight-kicking-the-ball-at-an-opponent/)

Headbutting (striking at someone with the head) unless negligible is violent conduct.

## Jumps at / charge / push / trip

Any offense with a shoulder or body to a completely upright opponent's neck or head is generally excessive force after jumping non-laterally or charging shoulder first. **Ask the player where they were hit** A shoulder to the front or back of a player's body (not the side) is generally a cuation.

Any offense where there is no attempt to challenge for or play the ball that causes an opponent's head or neck to directly hit a fixed object (the ground, goalpost, wall) is generally excessive force.

When the ball is out of play; the ball has cleary been held by the goalkeeper for a while; or the ball is no where close and no tactical reason, any deliberate action that causes an opponent to involuntairly fall down is violent conduct.

## Tackle / kicks

Studs on any body part except the foot that is not glancing should be excessive force. **Ask the player where they were hit and show the marks from the studs penetrating the skin with clear stud outlines before making a decision - it is okay to make or change a decision based on the injury in this case. If skin is red with no penetration and no stud outlines, studs grazed the skin is usually just a caution.**

Studs on a player's foot that occurs after a slide, jump, or lunge should be excessive force.

A kick/tackle to the head or neck that that uses high force (e.g. bicycle kicks) **Ask the player where they were hit**
- [Serious Foul Play 1.](https://youtu.be/kgO-Zrmj-sE?feature=shared&t=220), [Serious Foul Play 2](https://youtu.be/8kmliIasCfQ?feature=shared&t=63)

A scissor tackle is a dangerous challenge with legs apart, so as to trap the opponent's leg or legs in between.
- [Serious Foul Play 1.](https://youtu.be/ZGnfVHgeO88?feature=shared&t=32)

Unnessary/avoidable contact to the goalkeeper's head or neck (esspecially when on the ground). The attacker must make every attempt to avoid the goalkeeper. If negligable or glancing contact, a caution should be given. **Ask the goalkeeper where they were hit**
- [PRO write up here. I consider it Serious Foul Play.](https://proreferees.com/2022/07/02/talking-points-avoidable-contact-with-goalkeepers/)

A slide tackle feet first into the goalkeeper whose attempting to catch the ball while on the ground is almost always excessive force (whether or not studs grazed or penetrated the skin)
- [Serious Foul Play 1](https://youtu.be/jqf5Y88OYEM?feature=shared&t=924), [Serious Foul Play 2](https://www.tiktok.com/@refsneedlovetoo/video/7271366786551991594?lang=en)

A slide tackle with a secondary kicking motion (rather than pulling out) combines two powerful forces and can easily be a recipe for excessive force.

A tackle/stomp with high intensity or that is two-footed (with or without contact) or a slide tackle where the first contact is at the opponent's leg rather than the ground or a tackle/stomp when the ball is not playable.

When the ball is on the ground and not bouncing and a player gets kicked or tackled above the ankle with excessive force it's violent conduct
