The Laws of the Game designates three levels of physical severity - Careless, Reckless, and Excessive force. This wording is important - especially in match reports. A player is never sent-off for a reckless challenge and a player is never cautioned for a careless challenge.

> Careless is when a player shows a lack of attention or consideration when making a challenge or acts without precaution. No disciplinary sanction is needed
> 
> Reckless is when a player acts with disregard to the danger to, or consequences for, an opponent and must be cautioned
> 
> Using excessive force is when a player exceeds the necessary use of force and/or endangers the safety of an opponent and must be sent off
>
> Law 12.1 Direct Free Kicks

The level of physical foul does not depend on intention. A player can unintentionally and not deliberately use excessive force or recklessly commit a foul but that does not change the outcome of the referee's sanction.

> Serious foul play
> 
> A tackle or challenge that endangers the safety of an opponent or uses excessive force or brutality must be sanctioned as serious foul play.
> 
> Any player who lunges at an opponent in challenging for the ball from the front, from the side or from behind using one or both legs, with excessive force or endangers the safety of an opponent is guilty of serious foul play.

> Violent conduct
> 
> Violent conduct is when a player uses or attempts to use excessive force or brutality against an opponent when not challenging for the ball, or against a team-mate, team official, match official, spectator or any other person, regardless of whether contact is made.
> 
> In addition, a player who, when not challenging for the ball, deliberately strikes an opponent or any other person on the head or face with the hand or arm, is guilty of violent conduct unless the force used was negligible.

A player can be found to be using excessive force even if there is no or minimal contact made with the other person or the other person pulls out/avoids the situation.

Both serious foul play and violent conduct are both send-off offenses for using excessive force. It is impossible for an offense to be serious foul play and violent conduct at the same time. It can only be one. 

It is serious foul play if:
- a challenge is being made for the ball and
- the offense is against an opponent 

This distinction matters as competitions generally will suspend players for more games for violent conduct than serious foul play.

There are also offensive, insulting or abusive actions, including physical ones towards another person, that are not violent conduct and don't involve excessive force but should be a send-off. This includes deliberately pulling an opponent's pants down, slapping an opponent's butt, or kissing an opponent - this is covered in the the [misconduct section](/misconduct).

## Strikes at

There is a great write up from PRO about striking with the hands/arms [here](https://proreferees.com/2020/04/20/pro-insight-tool-or-weapon-challenging-with-hands-arms/).

If there is no tactical reason to strike the ball at someone (by throwing or kicking it) in their direction and with high speed, it is violent conduct. PRO has a  write up about kicking the ball at someone [here](https://proreferees.com/2021/06/10/pro-insight-kicking-the-ball-at-an-opponent/)

## Jumps at / charge / push / trip

A shoulder or body to the opponent's neck or head is generally excessive force. Cases to look for are jumping non-laterally or running shoulder first.

## Tackle / kicks

Studs on any body part except the foot that is not glancing should be excessive force. **Ask the player where they were hit and if possible to show the marks from the studs before making a decision - it helps sell the descision and gives you extra time to think.**

A slide tackle with a secondary kicking motion (rather than pulling out) combines two powerful forces and can easily be a recipe for excessive force.
