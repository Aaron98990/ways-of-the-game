The restarts in soccer are the:
- kick-off
- corner kick
- goal kick
- throw-in
- penalty kick
- direct free kick
- indirect free kick
- dropped ball

#### Indirect Free Kick in Opponents' Penalty Area

Remember only direct free kick offenses may lead to a penalty kick.

> A penalty kick is awarded if a player commits a direct free kick offence inside their penalty area or off the field as part of play as outlined in Laws 12 and 13.
>
> Law 14 Penalty Kick

Some players call indirect free kicks "two touches" becuase it requires a touch from two different players. The indirect free kick taker can't touch the ball twice in a row. Goalkeeper handball in their own penalty area is an indirect free kick.

> if an indirect free kick is kicked directly into the opponentsâ€™ goal, a goal kick is awarded
>
> Law 13 Free Kicks

That unoffical signal for offside with the referee raising their hand straight up is the signal for indirect free kicks. It's rare to see a goal or a direct attempt at goal from a restart due to offside since it is usually more than halfway accross the field.

> The referee indicates an indirect free kick by raising the arm above the head; this signal is maintained until the kick has been taken and the ball touches another player, goes out of play or it is clear that a goal cannot be scored directly.
>
> Law 13 Free Kicks

Remember the following:

> indirect free kicks to the attacking team for an offence inside the opponentsâ€™ goal area are taken from the nearest point on the goal area line which runs parallel to the goal line
>
> The ball:
>
> is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves
> 
> Until the ball is in play, all opponents must remain:
> 
> at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the ball, unless they are on their own goal line between the goalposts
> 
> Law 13 Free Kicks

I personally do not allow quick indrect free kicks in the penalty area. It is too much chaos. At lower levels of the game, players should be reminded that two touches of the ball is needed before going in the goal.

[Example 1: The referee has their hand up. All opponents are on the goal line between the goalposts since they are less than 10 yds from the ball.](https://youtu.be/57Gs6vLMnvU?t=25)

We defined a kick before and lets define it again. The ball must be "kicked and clearly moves".

> Kick
> 
> The ball is kicked when a player makes contact with it with the foot and/or the ankle

> - Glossary - Football terms

If a player taps the ball with the bottom of their boot, that is a kick. Now, "clearly moves" is more subjective. The ball must not just move, it must clearly move. In these situations, you have the free kick taker take the smallest of touches before a second player kicks it at the goal. To who must it be the clear the ball moves. It is subjective and I offer this advice to you - follow the spirit of the game. ðŸ˜†
