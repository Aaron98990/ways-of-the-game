The restarts in soccer are the:

- kick-off
- corner kick
- goal kick
- throw-in
- penalty kick
- direct free kick
- indirect free kick
- dropped ball

### Stationary

Othrt than dropped balls and throw-ins, the ball must be stationary.

> The ball must be stationary

### Fiebting

> Feinting to take a free kick to confuse opponents is permitted as part of football.

> The penalty kick taker offens:
> - feinting to kick the ball once the kicker has completed the run-up (feinting in the run-up is permitted); the referee cautions the kicker

### Ball in play

Other than a throw-in and a dropped ball, the ball is in play from a restart when it is kicked and clearly moves and there are no other offenses.

> The ball:
> 
> is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves

We defined a kick before and lets define it again. The ball must be "kicked and clearly moves".

> Kick
> 
> The ball is kicked when a player makes contact with it with the foot and/or the ankle
> 
> - Glossary - Football terms

If a player taps the ball with the bottom of their boot, that is a kick. Now, "clearly moves" is more subjective. The ball must not just move, it must clearly move. In these situations, you have the free kick taker take the smallest of touches before a second player kicks it at the goal. To who must it be the clear the ball moves. It is subjective and I offer this advice to you - follow the spirit of the game. ðŸ˜†



For a throw-in the ball is in play when 

> The ball is in play when it enters the field of play.
> Law 15

For a dropped a ball the ball is 

> The ball is in play when it touches the ground.
> Law 8.1

## Distance


> 	All other players (of both teams) must remain at least 4 m (4.5 yds) from the ball until it is in play
> Law 8.1 Dropped Ball

> all players, except the player taking the kick-off, must be in their own half of the field of play
	â€¢	the opponents of the team taking the kick-off must be at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the ball until it is in play
> Law 8 Kickoff

> Until the ball is in play, all opponents must remain:
	â€¢	at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the ball, unless they are on their own goal line between the goalposts
	â€¢	outside the penalty area for [all goal kicks] and free kicks inside the opponentsâ€™ penalty area
> Law 13 / 16 / 17 Free Kicks / Goal kicks / Corner kicks

> Where three or more defending team players form a â€˜wallâ€™, all attacking team players must remain at least 1 m (1 yd) from the â€˜wallâ€™ until the ball is in play.
> Law 13 Free Kicks

> All opponents must stand at least 2 m (2 yds) from the point on the touchline where the throw-in is to be taken.
> Law 16 Throw-In

> The defending goalkeeper must remain on the goal line, facing the kicker, between the goalposts, until the ball is kicked.
> The players other than the kicker and goalkeeper must be:
	â€¢	at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the penalty mark
	â€¢	behind the penalty mark
	â€¢	inside the field of play
	â€¢	outside the penalty area
> Law 14 Penalty kick

### Double Touch
For all restarts except dropped balls, the person who takes the restart can't touch the ball until it touches another player. This touch includes deflections from any player from both teams. The ball hitting the goalpost or crossbar or corner post or match offical does not reset this rule.


> the kicker/thrower must not touch the ball again until it has touched another player

> A free kick can be taken by lifting the ball with a foot or both feet simultaneously.

GODO - Insert video

Dor dropped balls, the player can start drinbling the ball.

## Two touches before goal

An indriect free kick and dropped ball requires the ball to be touched by two players, before entering the goal.

All other restarts, you may scores a goal directly (without needing to touch another player) from the restart.

#### Indirect Free Kick in Opponents' Penalty Area

Remember only direct free kick offenses may lead to a penalty kick.

> A penalty kick is awarded if a player commits a direct free kick offence inside their penalty area or off the field as part of play as outlined in Laws 12 and 13.
> 
> Law 14 Penalty Kick

Some players call indirect free kicks "two touches" becuase it requires a touch from two different players. The indirect free kick taker can't touch the ball twice in a row. Goalkeeper handball in their own penalty area is an indirect free kick.

> if an indirect free kick is kicked directly into the opponentsâ€™ goal, a goal kick is awarded
> 
> Law 13 Free Kicks

That unoffical signal for offside with the referee raising their hand straight up is the signal for indirect free kicks. It's rare to see a goal or a direct attempt at goal from a restart due to offside since it is usually more than halfway accross the field.

> The referee indicates an indirect free kick by raising the arm above the head; this signal is maintained until the kick has been taken and the ball touches another player, goes out of play or it is clear that a goal cannot be scored directly.
> 
> Law 13 Free Kicks

Remember the following:

> indirect free kicks to the attacking team for an offence inside the opponentsâ€™ goal area are taken from the nearest point on the goal area line which runs parallel to the goal line
> 
> The ball:
> 
> is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves
> 
> Until the ball is in play, all opponents must remain:
> 
> at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the ball, unless they are on their own goal line between the goalposts
> 
> Law 13 Free Kicks

I personally do not allow quick indrect free kicks in the penalty area. It is too much chaos. At lower levels of the game, players should be reminded that two touches of the ball is needed before going in the goal.
