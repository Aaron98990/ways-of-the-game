The start and restarts of play (commonly just called restarts) are the:

- kick-off ([Law 8.1](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/the-start-and-restart-of-play/))
- dropped ball (Law 8.2)
- direct free kick (Law 13)
- indirect free kick (Law 13)
- penalty kick (Law 14)
- throw-in (Law 15)
- goal kick (Law 16)
- corner kick (Law 17)

I cover commonality among the laws and provide video links - I am not re-writing the Laws here and exclude some things. I encourage you to read directly from the Laws of the Game. Each restart Law is  short (less than one-page) and only takes about a minute to read. 

Penalties (penalty shoot-out), covered in Law 10.3, are not a restart. But they do build on top of the penalty kick (Law 14).

The goalkeeper releasing the ball after control with the hand/arms is not a restart as the ball remains in play. Read more in the [goalkeepers section](/goalkeeper).

## Changing the restart

> The referee may not change a restart decision [..] if play has restarted or the referee has signalled the end of the first or second half (including extra time) and left the field of play or abandoned the match. Law 5.2

**Deflections that occur when kicked from close distance are one of the most challening calls to make as it is hard to see the trajectory of the ball change or hear the touches since they are close. [Example 1](https://youtu.be/WSQOZZeL0T4?feature=shared&t=293) If the assistant referee says they saw the deflection, follow them.**


## Position of restart

The restart is taken at the position the offense requires or where the ball left the field of play except:
- Corner kicks can be taken any where in the corner area nearest to the point where the ball passed over the goal line
    - the corner flagpost must not be moved
- indirect free kicks for attackers in their oponent's goal area are taken from the nearest point on the goal area line which runs parallel to the goal line
- free kicks going out in goal area or goal kicks may be taken from anywhere in the goal area
- direct free kick for attackers in their oponent's penalty area are a penalty kick (taken at the penalty mark)
- The ball is dropped for the defending team goalkeeper anywhere in their penalty area if, when play was stopped when the ball was in the penalty area or the last touch of the ball was in the penalty area
    - In all other cases, the referee drops the ball for **one player** of the team that last touched the ball at the position where it last touched a player, an outside agent or, as outlined in Law 9.1, a match official 

## Feinting

> Feinting: An action which attempts to confuse an opponent. Glossary

Feinting is allowed on all restarts except one scenario during a penalty kick: "once the kicker has completed the run-up (feinting in the run-up is permitted); the referee cautions the kicker".
- [The player stops their run up on a free kick and acts confused. This is okay.](https://youtu.be/-PLA_JIfusI)
- [Messi feints kicking the ball once he has finished his run up for the penalty kick. The goal is disallowed, indirect free kick for opponents, and caution. ](https://youtu.be/OivBaku1q2s)

## Ball in play

- Other than a throw-in and a dropped ball, the ball is in play from a restart when the ball is stationary when kicked and the ball is kicked and clearly moves and there are no other offenses.
- For a throw-in, the ball is in play when it enters the field of play, there are no other offenses, and the thrower at the moment of delivering the ball obeys the following:
    - stand facing the field of play
    - have part of each foot on the touchline or on the ground outside the touchline
        - both feet can be on the field of play as long part of each foot is touching the touchline
     - throw the ball with both hands from behind and over the head from the point where it left the field of play
         - no offense in itself if the ball curves or one hand only guides the ball
- For a dropped a ball, the ball is when it directly touches the ground on the field of play after being dropped. 

> Kick: The ball is kicked when a player makes contact with it with the foot and/or the ankle. Glossary

If a player taps the ball with the bottom of their boot, that is a kick. Now, "clearly moves" is more subjective. The ball moving does not alone meet the requirement. For me, it must be clear that at least one opponent could of or should of seen the ball move. I believe it is in the "spirit of the game" to yell "ball in play" if it is not clear that the ball is in play and because I hate the trick corner kick play.
- [The ball does not clearly move. The restart should of been retaken. ](https://youtu.be/-FqA3g7-PTs)
- [The ball clearly moves (in my opinion) as even the opponent recognizes it. I believe its in the spirit of the game to yell 'ball in play' as the defender was confused whether the ball is in play or not.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1JXV-zqrgY)

## Distance

Until the ball is in play:
- For dropped balls, all other players except the one who the ball is dropped to (of both teams) must remain at least 4 m (4.5 yds) from the ball
- For kick-offs, all players, except the player taking the kick-off, must be in their own half of the field of play. 
- For free kicks and kick-offs all opponents must remain 10 yards from the ball
    - For indirect free kicks, defenders stand on the goal line when they can't give 10 yards
- For corner kicks, oppenents must stand 10 yards from the corner arc
- For free kicks, when three or more defending team players form a ‘wall’, all attacking team players must remain at least 1 m (1 yd) from the ‘wall’ 
- For free kicks going out and all goal kicks, opponents must remain outside the penalty area the restart is taken from
- For throw-ins, all opponents must stand at least 2 m (2 yds) from the point on the touchline where the throw-in is to be taken.
- For penalty kicks, the goalkeeper must have part of one foot in line or behind the goal line when the ball is kicked. Everyone except the kicker and goalkeeper, must be outside the penalty area, behind the penalty mark, and 10 yards from the penalty mark.
    - [Retake. Goalkeeper does not have part of both feet in line or behind the goal line when the ball is kicked and is blocked by them. ](https://youtu.be/9o6zJz1neG0?t=49)
    - [Retake. Goalkeeper does not have part of both feet in line or behind the goal line when the ball is kicked and is blocked by them. ](https://youtu.be/gAoXLwQ_2b4?t=96)

## Quick restarts

> If, when a goal kick is taken, any opponents are inside the penalty area because they did not have time to leave, the referee allows play to continue. If an opponent who is in the penalty area when the goal kick is taken, or enters the penalty area before the ball is in play, touches or challenges for the ball before it is in play, the goal kick is retaken.

> If, when a free kick is taken, an opponent is closer to the ball than the required distance, the kick is retaken unless the advantage can be applied; but if a player takes a free kick quickly and an opponent who is less than 9.15 m (10 yds) from the ball intercepts it, the referee allows play to continue. However, an opponent who deliberately prevents a free kick being taken quickly must be cautioned for delaying the restart of play. 

Please note that a penalty kick and kick-off can never be taken quickly and always require the referee to make a signal (e.g. blow a whistle) before the ball is put into play else its a retake. 

> After the players have taken positions in accordance with this Law, the referee signals for the penalty kick to be taken. Law 14


> For every kick-off: the referee gives a signal Law 8

If the referee measures distance on a free kick or wants to restart play from a card, sub, or injury (or any other extended break like a cooling/drinks "water" break), the whistle should be used. 

> The whistle is needed to:
> - restart play for:
> 	- free kicks when the appropriate distance is required
> - restart play after it has been stopped for a:
> 	- caution or sending-off
> 	- injury
> 	- substitution
> - Guideline for Match Officials

- [The penalty kick is taken before the referee signals (whistle). The penalty kick is re-taken.](https://youtu.be/w5QBxc2Hq0o?feature=shared&t=8659)
- [The referee measures the distance for a free kick. Because the free kick is taken before the signal (whistle), the free kick has to be re-taken.](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-HZviMbqxc?feature=shared&t=2625)

## Delaying the restart of play

> An opponent who deliberately prevents a free kick being taken quickly must be cautioned for delaying the restart of play. Law 13

- [The defender stands right in front of the ball and prevents a free kick being taken quickly. The player is cautioned.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDdkvYZLql0&list=PL4OiywE4asSeoUa31AgCWC5tauGkE4uFj&index=4)
- [Same as the above.](https://youtu.be/VqaCkXYPsjM?feature=shared&t=4250)

> Referees must caution players who delay the restart of play by:
> - appearing to take a throw-in but suddenly leaving it to a team-mate to take
> - delaying leaving the field of play when being substituted
> - excessively delaying a restart
> - kicking or carrying the ball away, or provoking a confrontation by deliberately touching the ball after the referee has stopped play
> - taking a free kick from the wrong position to force a retake

Time-wasting often falls into this category. The referee must be aware that in close games, the winning team will try to go slower and should push the team to go faster. If they ignore those commands, the referee should not hesitate on punishing the offense.
- [A player attempts to waste time by taking over 30 seconds to take a free kick and is cautioned.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDBtmd86jPc&list=PL4OiywE4asSeoUa31AgCWC5tauGkE4uFj&index=10)
- [The player keeps dribbling the ball although the restart belongs to the other team. The player is cautioned.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPq6DlxrG0&list=PL4OiywE4asSeoUa31AgCWC5tauGkE4uFj&index=18)
- [During a substitution the player takes longer than necessary to leave the field. The player is cautioned.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilHTBKTW-Kg&list=PL4OiywE4asSeoUa31AgCWC5tauGkE4uFj&index=20)
- [The player provokes a confrontation by blocking the opponent from getting the ball to restart play. The player should be cautioned.](https://youtu.be/5OJfbYQtKtk?t=4061)
- [The player provokes a confrontation by holding onto the ball. The player should be cautioned.](https://youtu.be/5eRf_iP_zK8?feature=shared&t=567)

The referee channel has a list of 21 videos of examples of this that are available [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4OiywE4asSeoUa31AgCWC5tauGkE4uFj). A referee may be able to give a public warning before giving a caution, especially in cases with limited tactical impact (e.g. kicking the ball towards the goal after offside is called when in/near the penalty area or the losing team wasting their own time). 

## Failure to respect distance

> A player is cautioned if guilty of: failing to respect the required distance when play is restarted with a dropped ball, corner kick, free kick or throw-in Law 12.3

- [The ball is put into play after the referee measured distance for a free kick. The player is cautioned. ](https://youtu.be/kJcR7CNMdQc?feature=shared&t=2876)

## Double touch by restart taker

For all restarts except dropped balls, the person who takes the restart can't touch the ball until it touches another player else its an indirect free kick. This touch includes deflections from any player from both teams. The ball hitting the goalpost or crossbar or corner post or match official does not reset this rule. Read more in the "two offenses at once" section

- [Penalty kick taker touches the ball after kicking it and after slipping but before it touches another player. The restart is an indirect free kick for their opponents.](https://youtu.be/b5vJ7HO5G5s?t=742)
- [Penalty kick taker touches the ball after kicking it and after it rebounds from the goalpost but before it touches another player. The restart is an indirect free kick for their opponents.](https://youtu.be/qVe3wSeTY8U?t=47)

"A free kick can be taken by lifting the ball with a foot or both feet simultaneously" - this applies to any restart that is kicked

For dropped balls, any player can start dribbing the ball as the ball is in play.

## Two touches before opponent's goal

An throw-in, indriect free kick and dropped ball requires the ball to be touched by two players, before entering the opponent's goal else its a goal kick. 

All other restarts, you may scores a goal in the opponent's goal directly (without the ball needing to touch another player other than the kicker) from the restart.

## Own goal directly from restart

From all restarts, you can't directly score an own-goal. Directly means only the person taking the restart touched the ball before it enters the goal.  If you do, it's a corner kick for your opponents. 
- "if the ball directly enters the [kicker’s/thrower's] goal, a corner kick is awarded to the opponents"

Dropped ball follows the same idea as above - except it also applies if only one person touches the ball (even multiple times):
- "If a dropped ball enters the goal without touching at least two players, play is restarted with: a corner kick if it enters the team’s goal"

## Striking the ball at an opponent

Deliberately throwing (from a throw-in) or deliberately kicking the ball at an opponent is acceptable if it is not careless, reckless, or using excessive force when the ball is in play else it's a direct free kick for striking.

> If a player, while correctly taking a [free kick/throw-in/corner kick], deliberately [kicks/throws] the ball at an opponent in order to play the ball again but not in a careless or reckless manner or using excessive force, the referee allows play to continue.

## Holding during restarts

> Referees are reminded to make an early intervention and to deal firmly with holding offenses, especially inside the penalty area at corner kicks and free kicks. To deal with these situations:
> - the referee must warn any player holding an opponent before the ball is in play
> - caution the player if the holding continues before the ball is in play
> - award a direct free kick or penalty kick and caution the player if it happens once the ball is in play
> - Guidelines for Match Officials

[The referee stops the corner kick and warns players to stop holding.](https://youtu.be/5OJfbYQtKtk?t=2012)

## Standing in front of the goalkeeper

On corner kicks, players like to stand in front of goalkeepers to limit their movement.  This is covered extensively in the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper)

## Indirect Free Kick

Only direct free kick offenses may lead to a penalty kick. Indirect free kicks can occur in the opponent's penalty area and if they do and the ball is closer than 10 yards from the goal line, defenders can stand on the goal line. Some players call indirect free kicks "two touches" because it requires a touch from two different players before entering the opponent's goal else it's a goal kick. Most indirect free kick offenses are covered [here](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/fouls-and-misconduct/#indirect-free-kick) but the most common indirect free kick offnese is offside.

> The referee indicates an indirect free kick by raising the arm above the head; this signal is maintained until the kick has been taken and the ball touches another player, goes out of play or it is clear that a goal cannot be scored directly.
> - Law 13 Free Kicks

> if an indirect free kick is kicked directly into the opponents’ goal, a goal kick is awarded Law 13

> Until the ball is in play, all opponents must remain: at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the ball, unless they are on their own goal line between the goalposts. Law 13

- [Example 1: The referee has their hand up. All opponents are on the goal line between the goalposts since they are less than 10 yds from the ball.](https://youtu.be/57Gs6vLMnvU?t=25)
- [Example 2: The referee has their hand up. All opponents are on the goal line between the goalposts since they are less than 10 yds from the ball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARC-zVHgsA8)

## Two offenses at once

> If, after the ball is in play, the [thrower/kicker] touches the ball again before it has touched another player, an indirect free kick is awarded; if the [thrower/kicker] commits a handball offense:
> - a direct free kick is awarded
> - a penalty kick is awarded if the offense occurred inside the [kicker’s/thrower's] penalty area unless the ball was handled by the defending team’s goalkeeper, in which case an indirect free kick is awarded

> The referee:
> - punishes the more serious offense, in terms of sanction, restart, physical severity and tactical impact, when more than one offense occurs at the same time
> - Law 5.3- Powers and duties

One just clarifies the other. So, if there are more than one offenses at once we go down the tie-breaker list:
- Sanction
- Restart
- Physical severity
- Tactical impact

If directly after taking the restart a non-goalkeeper picks up the ball anywhere or a goalkeeper picks up the ball outside their penalty area, two offenses have been committed at once:
- handball, punished by a direct free kick
- restart kicker/thrower touches the ball again before it has touched another player, punished by an indirect free kick

Let's go to our tie-breaker list we stated above:
- Sanction - both will be the same (both have same tactical impact - none/SPA/DOGSO)
- Restart - the direct free kick offense (handball) tops the indirect free kick offense (double touch)

Therefore, the offense is handball only since it is more serious and we restart with a direct free kick.

If a goalkeeper picks up the ball in their penalty area (covered deeply in the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper)) directly after taking the restart, they have committed one offense:
- restart kicker/thrower touches the ball again before it has touched another player, punished by a indirect free kick
