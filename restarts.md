The restarts in soccer are the:

- kick-off (Law 8.1)
- dropped ball (Law 8.2)
- direct free kick (Law 13)
- indirect free kick (Law 13)
- penalty kick (Law 14)
- throw-in (Law 15)
- goal kick (Law 16)
- corner kick (Law 17)

I cover commonality among the laws and provide video links - I not re-writing the Laws here. I really encourage you to read directly from the Laws of the Game. Each restart Law is super short (less than one-page) and only takes about a minute to read. [Here's the link here](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/the-start-and-restart-of-play/) so it's easy to get started then follow along the restarts listed above with the associated law number.

Please note that Penalties (penalty shoot-out), covered in Law 10.3, are not a restart. But they are very similar to the penalty kick (Law 15) so penalties are covered here.

Also, please note that the goalkeeper releasing the ball after possession with the hand/arms is not a restart as the ball remains in play. Read more in the [goalkeepers section](/goalkeeper).

## Changing the restart

> The referee may not change a restart decision [..] if play has restarted or the referee has signalled the end of the first or second half (including extra time) and left the field of play or abandoned the match. Law 5.2

## Stationary

Other than dropped balls and throw-ins, the ball must be stationary when kicked.

### Fienting

> Feinting: An action which attempts to confuse an opponent. Glossary

Feinting is allowed on all restarts except one scenario during a penalty kick: "once the kicker has completed the run-up (feinting in the run-up is permitted); the referee cautions the kicker".
- [The player stops their run up on a free kick and acts confused. This is okay.](https://youtu.be/-PLA_JIfusI)
- [Messi feints kicking the ball once he has finished his run up for the penalty kick. The goal is disallowed, indirect free kick for opppnents, and caution. ](https://youtu.be/OivBaku1q2s)

## Ball in play

- Other than a throw-in and a dropped ball, the ball is in play from a restart when it is kicked and clearly moves and there are no other offenses.
- For a throw-in, the ball is in play when it enters the field of play.
- For a dropped a ball, the ball is when it touches the ground.

> Kick: The ball is kicked when a player makes contact with it with the foot and/or the ankle. Glossary

If a player taps the ball with the bottom of their boot, that is a kick. Now, "clearly moves" is more subjective. The ball moving does not alone meet the requirement. For me, it must be clear that at least one opponent could of or should of seen the ball move. I believe it is in the "spirit of the game" to yell "ball in play" if it is not clear that the ball is in play. 
- [The ball does not clearly move. The restart should of been retaken. ](https://youtu.be/-FqA3g7-PTs)
- [The ball cleary moves (in my opinion) as even the opponent recognizes it. I believe its in the spirit of the game to yell 'ball in play' as the defender was confused whether the ball is in play or not.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1JXV-zqrgY)


## Distance

Until the ball is in play:
- For dropped balls, all other players except the one who the ball is dropped to (of both teams) must remain at least 4 m (4.5 yds) from the ball
- For kick-offs, all players, except the player taking the kick-off, must be in their own half of the field of play. 
- For free kicks, kick-offs, and corner kicks, all opponents must remain 10 yards from the ball
- For free kicks, when three or more defending team players form a ‘wall’, all attacking team players must remain at least 1 m (1 yd) from the ‘wall’ 
- For free kicks in the opponents' penalty area and all goalkicks , opponents must remain out of the opponents' penalty area
- For throw-ins, all opponents must stand at least 2 m (2 yds) from the point on the touchline where the throw-in is to be taken.
- For penalty kicks, the goalkeeper must be on the goalline. Everyone except the goalkeeper must be behind the penalty spot. Everyone except the kicker and goalkeeper, must be outside the penalty area.

## Quick restarts

> If, when a goal kick is taken, any opponents are inside the penalty area because they did not have time to leave, the referee allows play to continue. If an opponent who is in the penalty area when the goal kick is taken, or enters the penalty area before the ball is in play, touches or challenges for the ball before it is in play, the goal kick is retaken.

> If, when a free kick is taken, an opponent is closer to the ball than the required distance, the kick is retaken unless the advantage can be applied; but if a player takes a free kick quickly and an opponent who is less than 9.15 m (10 yds) from the ball intercepts it, the referee allows play to continue. However, an opponent who deliberately prevents a free kick being taken quickly must be cautioned for delaying the restart of play. 

Please note that a penalty kick and kick-off can never be taken quickly and always require the referee to make a signal (e.g. blow a whistle) before the ball is put into play.
- "After the players have taken positions in accordance with this Law, the referee signals for the penalty kick to be taken."
- "For every kick-off: the referee gives a signal"

If the referee measures distance on a free kick or wants to restart play from a card, sub, or injury (or any other extended break like a cooling/drinks "water" break), the whistle should be used. 

> The whistle is needed to:
> - restart play for:
> 	- free kicks when the appropriate distance is required
> - restart play after it has been stopped for a:
> 	- caution or sending-off
> 	- injury
> 	- substitution
> - Guideline for Match Officals

[The referee measures the distance for a free kick and puts the white foam where defenders can stand. Because the free kick is taken before the whistle to restart is blown, the free kick has to be re-taken.](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-HZviMbqxc?feature=shared&t=2625)

## Delaying the restart of play

"An opponent who deliberately prevents a free kick being taken quickly must be cautioned for delaying the restart of play." Law 13
- [The defender stands right in front of the ball and fails to make an attempt to all allow the free kick to be taken. The player is cautioned.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDdkvYZLql0&list=PL4OiywE4asSeoUa31AgCWC5tauGkE4uFj&index=4)

> Referees must caution players who delay the restart of play by:
> - appearing to take a throw-in but suddenly leaving it to a team-mate to take
> - delaying leaving the field of play when being substituted
> - excessively delaying a restart
> - kicking or carrying the ball away, or provoking a confrontation by deliberately touching the ball after the referee has stopped play
> - taking a free kick from the wrong position to force a retake

Time-wasting offen falls into this category. The referee must be aware that in close games, the winning team will try to go slower and should push the team to go faster. If they ignore those commands, the referee should not hesitate on punishing the offense.
- [A player attempts to waste time by taking over 30 seconds to take a free kick and is cautioned.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDBtmd86jPc&list=PL4OiywE4asSeoUa31AgCWC5tauGkE4uFj&index=10)
- [The player keeps dribbling the ball although the restart belongs to the other team. The player is cautioned.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPq6DlxrG0&list=PL4OiywE4asSeoUa31AgCWC5tauGkE4uFj&index=18)
- [During a substitution the player takes longer than necessary to leave the field. The player is cautioned.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilHTBKTW-Kg&list=PL4OiywE4asSeoUa31AgCWC5tauGkE4uFj&index=20)
- [The player provokes a confrontation by blocking the opponent from getting the ball to restart play. The player should be cautioned.](https://youtu.be/5OJfbYQtKtk?t=4061)

The referee channel has a list of 21 videos of examples of this that are available [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4OiywE4asSeoUa31AgCWC5tauGkE4uFj). A referee may be able to give a public warning before giving a caution, esspecially in cases with limited tactical impact (e.g. kicking the ball towards the goal after offside is called). 

## Failure to respect distance

> A player is cautioned if guilty of:
> - failing to respect the required distance when play is restarted with a dropped ball, corner kick, free kick or throw-in Law 12.3

### Double Touch

For all restarts except dropped balls, the person who takes the restart can't touch the ball until it touches another player. This touch includes deflections from any player from both teams. The ball hitting the goalpost or crossbar or corner post or match offical does not reset this rule.

"the [kicker/thrower must] not touch the ball again until it has touched another player"
- [Penalty kick taker touches the ball after kicking it and after slipping but before it touches another player. The restart is an indirect free kick for their opponents.](https://youtu.be/b5vJ7HO5G5s?t=742)
- [Penalty kick taker touches the ball after kicking it and after it rebounds from the goalpost but before it touches another player. The restart is an indirect free kick for their opponents.](https://youtu.be/qVe3wSeTY8U?t=47)
"A free kick can be taken by lifting the ball with a foot or both feet simultaneously" - this applies to any restart that is kicked

For dropped balls, the player can start drinbling the ball as the ball is in play.

## Two touches before opponent's goal

An throw-in, indriect free kick and dropped ball requires the ball to be touched by two players, before entering the opponent's goal.

All other restarts, you may scores a goal in the opponent's goal directly (without the ball needing to touch another player other than the kicker) from the restart.

## Own goal directly from restart

From all restarts, you can't directly score an own-goal. Directly means only the person taking the restart touched the ball before it enters the goal.  If you do, it's a corner kick for your opponents. 
- "if the ball directly enters the [kicker’s/thrower's] goal, a corner kick is awarded to the opponents"

Dropped ball follows the same idea as above - but in a dropped ball you start dribbling with the ball immediatly:
- "If a dropped ball enters the goal without touching at least two players, play is restarted with: a corner kick if it enters the team’s goal"

## Striking the ball at an opponent

Deliberately throwing (from a throw-in only) or deliberately kicking the ball at an opponent is acceptable if it is not careless, reckless, or using excessive force. This includes at a restart, when the ball is in play, and when the ball is out of play. Striking or attempting to strake an opponent is a direct free kick offense.

> If a player, while correctly taking a [free kick/throw-in/corner kick], deliberately [kicks/throws] the ball at an opponent in order to play the ball again but not in a careless or reckless manner or using excessive force, the referee allows play to continue.
> Law 13, 15, 17

## Holding an opponent

> Referees are reminded to make an early intervention and to deal firmly with holding offences, especially inside the penalty area at corner kicks and free kicks. To deal with these situations:
> - the referee must warn any player holding an opponent before the ball is in play
> - caution the player if the holding continues before the ball is in play
> - award a direct free kick or penalty kick and caution the player if it happens once the ball is in play
> - Guidelines for Match Officals

[The referee stops the corner kick and warns players to stop holding.](https://youtu.be/5OJfbYQtKtk?t=2012)

## Standing in front of the goalkeeper

On corner kicks players like to stand in front of goalkeepers to limit their movement.  This is covered extensively in the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper)

 From here on out I cover each restart and there specific separatly:

## Penalty Kick

[Goalkeeper does not have part of both feet in line or behind the goalline when the ball is kicked.](https://youtu.be/9o6zJz1neG0?t=49)

[Goalkeeper does not have part of both feet in line or behind the goalline when the ball is kicked.](https://youtu.be/gAoXLwQ_2b4?t=96)


While it's not techically wrong to penalize a player for encroaching when they have no impact on play, I consider this trifling and would never penlize for it. VAR only intervenes for penalty kick encroachment if the player impacts play. 

> Not penalizing encroachment by an attacker or defender who does not directly become involved in play.
> 
> - The penalty kick law is not meant to be strictly read.
> 
> Ways of the Game - Spirit of the Game





## Throw-in

On a throw-in both feet do not need to be outside the field of play. The Law 15 says this:
> At the moment of delivering the ball, the thrower must:
>
> - have part of each foot on the touchline or on the ground outside the touchline

## Indirect Free Kick in Opponents' Penalty Area

Remember only direct free kick offenses may lead to a penalty kick. Some players call indirect free kicks "two touches" becuase it requires a touch from two different players. The indirect free kick taker can't touch the ball twice in a row. Handball by the goalkeeper in their own penalty area is an indirect free kick.

> if an indirect free kick is kicked directly into the opponents’ goal, a goal kick is awarded
> - Law 13 Free Kicks

> The referee indicates an indirect free kick by raising the arm above the head; this signal is maintained until the kick has been taken and the ball touches another player, goes out of play or it is clear that a goal cannot be scored directly.
> - Law 13 Free Kicks

> indirect free kicks to the attacking team for an offence inside the opponents’ goal area are taken from the nearest point on the goal area line which runs parallel to the goal line

> Until the ball is in play, all opponents must remain:
> - at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the ball, unless they are on their own goal line between the goalposts
> - Law 13 Free Kicks

I personally do not allow quick indrect free kicks in the penalty area. It is too much chaos. At lower levels of the game, players should be reminded that two touches of the ball is needed before going in the goal.

- [Example 1: The referee has their hand up. All opponents are on the goal line between the goalposts since they are less than 10 yds from the ball.](https://youtu.be/57Gs6vLMnvU?t=25)
- [Example 2: The referee has their hand up. All opponents are on the goal line between the goalposts since they are less than 10 yds from the ball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARC-zVHgsA8)


## Two offenses at once

> If, after the ball is in play, the [thrower/kicker] touches the ball again before it has touched another player, an indirect free kick is awarded; if the [thrower/kicker] commits a handball offence:
> - a direct free kick is awarded
> - a penalty kick is awarded if the offence occurred inside the [kicker’s/thrower's] penalty area unless the ball was handled by the defending team’s goalkeeper, in which case an indirect free kick is awarded

> The referee:
> - punishes the more serious offence, in terms of sanction, restart, physical severity and tactical impact, when more than one offence occurs at the same time
> - Law 5.3- Powers and duties

One just clarifies the other. So, if there are more than one offenses at once we go down the tie-breaker list:
- Sanction
- Restart
- Physical severity
- Tactical impact

If a non-goalkeeper picks up the ball anywhere or a goalkeeper picks up the ball outside their penalty area, two offenses have been commited at once:
- handball, punished by a direct free kick
- restart kicker/thrower touches the ball again before it has touched another player, punished by an indirect free kick

Let's go to our tie-breaker list we stated above:
- Sanction - both will be the same (both have same tactical impact - none/SPA/DOGSO)
- Restart - the direct free kick offense (handball) tops the indirect free kick offense (double touch)

Therefore, the offense is handball only since it is more serious and we restart with a direct free kick.

If a goalkeeeper picks up the ball in their penalty area (covered deeply in the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper), two offenses ahve been commited at once:
- handball by the goalkeeper in their own penalty area, punished by an indirect free kick
- restart kicker/thrower touches the ball again before it has touched another player, punished by a indirect free kick

Both are indirect free kick offenses so the restart will be an indirect free kick. I cover the appropiate disciplinary action for the goalkeeper picking up the ball in their penalty area [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper) in the "Two offenses at once" section.
