The restarts in soccer are the:

- kick-off (Law 8.1)
- dropped ball (Law 8.2)
- direct free kick (Law 13)
- indirect free kick (Law 13)
- penalty kick (Law 14)
- throw-in (Law 15)
- goal kick (Law 16)
- corner kick (Law 17)

I cover commonality among the laws and provide video links - I not re-writing the Laws here. I really encourage you to read directly from the Laws of the Game. Each restart Law is super short (less than one-page) and only takes about a minute to read. [Here's the link here](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/the-start-and-restart-of-play/) so it's easy to get started then follow along the restarts listed above with the associated law number.

Please note that Penalties (penalty shoot-out), covered in Law 10.3, are not a restart. But they are very similar to the penalty kick (Law 15) so penalties are covered here.

Also, please note that the goalkeeper releasing the ball after possession with the hand/arms is not a restart as the ball remains in play. Read more in the [goalkeepers section](/goalkeeper).

### Stationary

Othrt than dropped balls and throw-ins, the ball must be stationary when kicked.

> The ball must be stationary

### Fienting

Feinting is allowed on all restarts except in one scenario during a penalty kick.

> Feinting
> An action which attempts to confuse an opponent.
> Glossary

> Feinting to take a free kick to confuse opponents is permitted as part of football.

[The player stops their run up on a free kick and acts confused. This is okay.](https://youtu.be/-PLA_JIfusI)

> The penalty kick taker offends:
> 
> - feinting to kick the ball once the kicker has completed the run-up (feinting in the run-up is permitted); the referee cautions the kicker

[Messi feints kicking the ball once he has finished his run up for the penalty kick. The goal is disallowed, indirect free kick for opppnents, and caution. ](https://youtu.be/OivBaku1q2s)

### Ball in play

Other than a throw-in and a dropped ball, the ball is in play from a restart when it is kicked and clearly moves and there are no other offenses.

> The ball:
> 
> is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves

We defined a kick before and lets define it again. The ball must be "kicked and clearly moves".

> Kick
> 
> The ball is kicked when a player makes contact with it with the foot and/or the ankle
> 
> - Glossary - Football terms

If a player taps the ball with the bottom of their boot, that is a kick. Now, "clearly moves" is more subjective. The ball moving does not alone meet the requirement. For me, it must be clear that at least one opponent could of or should of seen the ball move. I believe it is in the "spirit of the game" to yell "ball in play" if it is not clear that the ball is in play.

[The ball does not clearly move. The restart should of been retaken. ](https://youtu.be/-FqA3g7-PTs)

For a throw-in the ball is in play when 

> The ball is in play when it enters the field of play.
> Law 15

For a dropped a ball the ball is 

> The ball is in play when it touches the ground.
> Law 8.1

## Distance

> All other players (of both teams) must remain at least 4 m (4.5 yds) from the ball until it is in play
> 
> Law 8.1 Dropped Ball

> all players, except the player taking the kick-off, must be in their own half of the field of play
>     •    the opponents of the team taking the kick-off must be at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the ball until it is in play
> Law 8 Kickoff

> Until the ball is in play, all opponents must remain:
>     •    at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the ball, unless they are on their own goal line between the goalposts
>     •    outside the penalty area for [all goal kicks] and free kicks inside the opponents’ penalty area
> Law 13 / 16 / 17 Free Kicks / Goal kicks / Corner kicks

> Where three or more defending team players form a ‘wall’, all attacking team players must remain at least 1 m (1 yd) from the ‘wall’ until the ball is in play.
> Law 13 Free Kicks

> All opponents must stand at least 2 m (2 yds) from the point on the touchline where the throw-in is to be taken.
> Law 16 Throw-In

> The defending goalkeeper must remain on the goal line, facing the kicker, between the goalposts, until the ball is kicked.
> The players other than the kicker and goalkeeper must be:
>     •    at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the penalty mark
>     •    behind the penalty mark
>     •    inside the field of play
>     •    outside the penalty area
> Law 14 Penalty kick

## Quick restarts

> If, when a goal kick is taken, any opponents are inside the penalty area because they did not have time to leave, the referee allows play to continue. If an opponent who is in the penalty area when the goal kick is taken, or enters the penalty area before the ball is in play, touches or challenges for the ball before it is in play, the goal kick is retaken.

> If, when a free kick is taken, an opponent is closer to the ball than the required distance, the kick is retaken unless the advantage can be applied; but if a player takes a free kick quickly and an opponent who is less than 9.15 m (10 yds) from the ball intercepts it, the referee allows play to continue. However, an opponent who deliberately prevents a free kick being taken quickly must be cautioned for delaying the restart of play. 

Please note that a penalty kick and kick-off can never be taken quickly and always require the referee to make a signal (e.g. blow a whistle) before the ball is put into play.

> After the players have taken positions in accordance with this Law, the referee signals for the penalty kick to be taken.

> For every kick-off:
> 
> - the referee gives a signal

If the referee measures distance on a free kick or wants to restart play from a card, sub, or injury, the whistle should be used. 

The whistle is needed to:
restart play for:
	•	free kicks when the appropriate distance is required
restart play after it has been stopped for a:
	•	caution or sending-off
	•	injury
	•	substitution
Guideline for Match Officals

## Delaying the restart of play

> An opponent who deliberately prevents a free kick being taken quickly must be cautioned for delaying the restart of play. Law 13

[The defender stands right in front of the ball and fails to make an attempt to all allow the free kick to be taken. The player is cautioned.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDdkvYZLql0&list=PL4OiywE4asSeoUa31AgCWC5tauGkE4uFj&index=4)

> Referees must caution players who delay the restart of play by:
>
> - appearing to take a throw-in but suddenly leaving it to a team-mate to take
>
> - delaying leaving the field of play when being substituted
>
> - excessively delaying a restart
>
> - kicking or carrying the ball away, or provoking a confrontation by deliberately touching the ball after the referee has stopped play
>
> - taking a free kick from the wrong position to force a retake

Time-wasting offen falls into this category. The referee must be aware that in close games, the winning team will try to go slower and should push the team to go faster. If they ignore those commands, the referee should not hesitate on punishing the offense.

[A player attempts to waste time by taking over 30 seconds to take a free kick and is cautioned.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDBtmd86jPc&list=PL4OiywE4asSeoUa31AgCWC5tauGkE4uFj&index=10)

[The player keeps dribbling the ball although the restart belongs to the other team. The player is cautioned.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPq6DlxrG0&list=PL4OiywE4asSeoUa31AgCWC5tauGkE4uFj&index=18)

[During a substitution the player takes longer than necessary to leave the field. The player is cautioned.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilHTBKTW-Kg&list=PL4OiywE4asSeoUa31AgCWC5tauGkE4uFj&index=20)

[The player provokes a confrontation by blocking the opponent from getting the ball to restart play. The player should be cautioned.](https://youtu.be/5OJfbYQtKtk?t=4061)

The referee channel has a list of 21 videos of examples of this that are available [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4OiywE4asSeoUa31AgCWC5tauGkE4uFj). A referee may be able to give a public warning before giving a caution, esspecially in cases with limited tactical impact (e.g. kicking the ball towards the goal after offside is called). 

## Failure to respect distance

> A player is cautioned if guilty of:
> - failing to respect the required distance when play is restarted with a dropped ball, corner kick, free kick or throw-in Law 12.3

### Double Touch

For all restarts except dropped balls, the person who takes the restart can't touch the ball until it touches another player. This touch includes deflections from any player from both teams. The ball hitting the goalpost or crossbar or corner post or match offical does not reset this rule.

> the kicker/thrower must not touch the ball again until it has touched another player

> A free kick can be taken by lifting the ball with a foot or both feet simultaneously.

[Penalty kick taker touches the ball after kicking it and after slipping but before it touches another player. The restart is an indirect free kick for their opponents.](https://youtu.be/b5vJ7HO5G5s?t=742)

[Penalty kick taker touches the ball after kicking it and after it rebounds from the goalpost but before it touches another player. The restart is an indirect free kick for their opponents.](https://youtu.be/qVe3wSeTY8U?t=47)


For dropped balls, the player can start drinbling the ball as the ball is in play.

## Two touches before opponent's goal

An throw-in, indriect free kick and dropped ball requires the ball to be touched by two players, before entering the opponent's goal.

All other restarts, you may scores a goal in the opponent's goal directly (without the ball needing to touch another player other than the kicker) from the restart.

## Own goal directly from restart

From all restarts, you can't directly score an own-goal. Directly means only the person taking the restart touched the ball before it enters the goal.  If you do, it's a corner kick for your opponents. 

> if the ball directly enters the [kicker’s/thrower's] goal, a corner kick is awarded to the opponents
> Law 8.1 Kick-off

Dropped ball follows the same idea as above - except covering the case where the player the ball is dropped to does not touch the ball.

> If a dropped ball enters the goal without touching at least two players, play is restarted with:

> a corner kick if it enters the team’s goal
> Law 8.2 Dropped ball

## Kicking or throwing the ball at an opponent

Deliberately throwing (from a throw-in only) or deliberately kicking the ball at an opponent is acceptable if it is not careless, reckless, or using excessive force. This includes at a restart, when the ball is in play, and when the ball is out of play.

> If a player, while correctly taking a [free kick/throw-in/corner kick], deliberately [kicks/throws] the ball at an opponent in order to play the ball again but not in a careless or reckless manner or using excessive force, the referee allows play to continue.
> Law 13, 15, 17

## Holding an opponent

> Referees are reminded to make an early intervention and to deal firmly with holding offences, especially inside the penalty area at corner kicks and free kicks. To deal with these situations:
>
> the referee must warn any player holding an opponent before the ball is in play
>
> caution the player if the holding continues before the ball is in play
>
> award a direct free kick or penalty kick and caution the player if it happens once the ball is in play
> Guidelines for Match Officals

[The referee stops the corner kick and warns players to stop holding.](https://youtu.be/5OJfbYQtKtk?t=2012)

## Standing in front of the goalkeeper

On corner kicks and free kicks players like to stand in front of goalkeepers to limit their movement.  This is covered extensively in the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper)

 From here on out I cover each restart and there specific separatly:

## Penalty Kick

[Goalkeeper does not have part of both feet in line or behind the goalline when the ball is kicked.](https://youtu.be/9o6zJz1neG0?t=49)

[Goalkeeper does not have part of both feet in line or behind the goalline when the ball is kicked.](https://youtu.be/gAoXLwQ_2b4?t=96)


While it's not techically wrong to penalize a player for encroaching when they have no impact on play, I consider this trifling and would never penlize for it. VAR only intervenes for penalty kick encroachment if the player impacts play.

## Throw-in

#### Indirect Free Kick in Opponents' Penalty Area

Remember only direct free kick offenses may lead to a penalty kick.

> A penalty kick is awarded if a player commits a direct free kick offence inside their penalty area or off the field as part of play as outlined in Laws 12 and 13.
> 
> Law 14 Penalty Kick

Some players call indirect free kicks "two touches" becuase it requires a touch from two different players. The indirect free kick taker can't touch the ball twice in a row. Goalkeeper handball in their own penalty area is an indirect free kick.

> if an indirect free kick is kicked directly into the opponents’ goal, a goal kick is awarded
> 
> Law 13 Free Kicks

That unoffical signal for offside with the referee raising their hand straight up is the signal for indirect free kicks. It's rare to see a goal or a direct attempt at goal from a restart due to offside since it is usually more than halfway accross the field.

> The referee indicates an indirect free kick by raising the arm above the head; this signal is maintained until the kick has been taken and the ball touches another player, goes out of play or it is clear that a goal cannot be scored directly.
> 
> Law 13 Free Kicks

Remember the following:

> indirect free kicks to the attacking team for an offence inside the opponents’ goal area are taken from the nearest point on the goal area line which runs parallel to the goal line
> 
> The ball:
> 
> is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves
> 
> Until the ball is in play, all opponents must remain:
> 
> at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the ball, unless they are on their own goal line between the goalposts
> 
> Law 13 Free Kicks

I personally do not allow quick indrect free kicks in the penalty area. It is too much chaos. At lower levels of the game, players should be reminded that two touches of the ball is needed before going in the goal.

[Example 1: The referee has their hand up. All opponents are on the goal line between the goalposts since they are less than 10 yds from the ball.](https://youtu.be/57Gs6vLMnvU?t=25)

[Example 2: The referee has their hand up. All opponents are on the goal line between the goalposts since they are less than 10 yds from the ball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARC-zVHgsA8)

### Advanced - Two offenses at once

Skip this if you value your time as the following covers a rare situation.

> If, after the ball is in play, the [thrower/kicker] touches the ball again before it has touched another player, an indirect free kick is awarded; if the [thrower/kicker] commits a handball offence:
> 
> - a direct free kick is awarded
> - a penalty kick is awarded if the offence occurred inside the [thrower’s/thrower's] penalty area unless the ball was handled by the defending team’s goalkeeper, in which case an indirect free kick is awarded

The above is just another Law enumerated out to be clear.

> The referee:
> 
> - punishes the more serious offence, in terms of sanction, restart, physical severity and tactical impact, when more than one offence occurs at the same time
> 
> - Law 5.3- Powers and duties

So, if there are more than one offenses at once we go down the tie-breaker list:

- Sanction

- Restart

- Physical severity

- Tactical impact

If a non-goalkeeper picks up the ball anywhere or a goalkeeper picks up the ball in their penalty area, two offenses have been commited at once:

- > A direct free kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offences:
  > 
  > - a handball offence (except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area)

- > If, after the ball is in play, the kicker/thrower touches the ball again before it has touched another player, an indirect free kick is awarded

Let's go to our tie-breaker list we stated above:

- Sanction - both will be the same

- Restart - the direct free kick offense (handball) tops the indirect free kick offense (double touch)

Therefore, the offense is handball only and we restart with a direct free kick.

---

If a goalkeeeper picks up the ball in their penalty area (covered deeply in the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper), two offenses ahve been commited at once:

- > If the goalkeeper handles the ball inside their penalty area when not permitted to do so, an indirect free kick is awarded
  > 
  > Law 12.1 Direct free kick

- > If, after the ball is in play, the kicker/thrower touches the ball again before it has touched another player, an indirect free kick is awarded

Both are indirect free kick offenses so the restart will be an indirect free kick. I cover the appropiate disciplinary action in the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper).
