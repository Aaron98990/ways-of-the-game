This is not an exhaustive list of Law changes - just significant ones. Many participants, including experience ones, are often not aware of Law Changes. 

The IFAB makes available all past Laws of the Game and Law Changes at https://www.theifab.com/documents/ - please note Law changes for 2018/19 and before only availbe in the back of the Laws of the Game PDF. Law Changes gives a nice summary, the before and after Law text, and explanation (and sometimes intention).

This is the only place I blatantly insert my opinion. Other places are less blatant.

## 2023/24

- Major change of the definition of  ‘deflection’ as realted to offside
  - Discussed in [Offside](/offside) - I like this change. 
  - I felt like the old deflection definition favored the attackers too much. We can't punish defenders for ... defending.
- Clarification for derermining the sanction for DOGSO or SPA for an offense that leads to a penalty kick. An attempt to play the ball includes challenging for the ball.
  - A player that charges into the back of an opponent may be attempting to play the ball
  - Great change! 

## 2022/23

- No major changes.

## 2021/22

- To allow some non-violent inappropriate behaviour to be considered ‘offensive, insulting or abusive’ and result in a sending-off, ‘action(s)/acting’ replace ‘gesture(s)/gesturing’ in the relevant descriptions
  
  - pulling down someone's pants, kicking someone, or slapping someone's butt would fall into this - just don't think "action" is the right word as punching someone - violent conduct is technically an action that is abusive and that may confuse newer referees

- Removal from the accidental attacking handball offence of the references to
  a ‘team-mate’ and ‘creating a goal-scoring opportunity’
  
  - great change - the accidental attacking handball period was too large. Esspecially with VAR, many goals were nullified that did not feel right.

- The offence of using a ‘trick’ to circumvent the Law against the goalkeeper handling the ball from a deliberate kick from a team-mate applies at goal kicks; the instigator is to be cautioned (YC)
  
  - An extension of the 2019/20 Law change of the ball free kicks and goal kicks are always in play when it clearly moves (not needing to leave the penalty area). This caused a lot of confusion at the time.

## 2020/21

- Yellow cards (YCs) and warnings are not carried forward into kicks from the penalty mark
  (KFPM)
  
  - I hate this change. One, it's confusing. 2 YC = 1 RC. Everyone knows that. Two, it encourages cheating and disruptive behavior. The rationale they give does not make sense.

## 2019/20

The Law Changes document for the year is [here](https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/changes-to-the-laws-of-the-game-2019-20_en?l=en). It is worth a review since many changes were made.

- Dropped ball – ball dropped for goalkeeper (if play stopped in penalty area) or for one player of team that last touched the ball at the location of the last touch; all other players (of both teams) must be at least 4 m (4.5 yds) away
  
  - Moving away from the contentest dropped ball. I love this change.

- Dropped ball if the ball touches the referee (or other match official) and goes into the goal, possession changes or an attacking move starts
  
  - I like this. But, I think possession change shoule be removed as it is too aggressive.

- Goalkeeper cannot score by throwing the ball into the opponents’ goal

- If, after a throw-in or deliberate kick from a team-mate, the goalkeeper unsuccessfully kicks or tries to kick the ball to release it into play, the goalkeeper can then handle the ball
  
  - I like. The "passback rule" is meant to keep the game flowing not weird goals like this. I have never since a goalkeeper catch the ball after doing this. Please send a video.

- All verbal offences are punished with an indirect free kick

- For defending team free kicks in their penalty area and all goal kicks, the ball is in play once it is kicked and clearly moves; it does not have to leave the penalty area

- Goalposts, crossbar and nets must not be moving when a penalty is taken and the goalkeeper must not be touching them

- Goalkeeper must have at least part of one foot on, or in line with, the goal line when a penalty kick is taken; cannot stand behind the line
  
  - For games with VAR this rules is enforced exactly as written. For games without VAR, only blatant offenses are punished. It is super hard for the AR to see this in real-time.

- Once an indirect free kick has been taken, the referee can stop showing the indirect free kick signal if it is clear that a goal cannot be scored directly (e.g. from most offside indirect free kicks)
  
  - Love it. 

- Referee can delay issuing a YC/RC until the next stoppage if the non-offending
  team takes a quick free kick and creates a goal-scoring opportunity

- If a penalty kick is awarded, the team’s penalty taker can receive assessment
  or treatment and then stay on the field and take the kick

- Referee cannot change a restart decision after play has restarted but a disciplinary sanction may only be issued after play has restarted if another match official had identified and attempted to communicate the offence to the referee before play
  restarted

## 2018/19

The Law Changes document for the year is [here on page 145](https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/laws-of-the-game-2018-19-single-pages?l=en). 

- Player who has left the field because of an equipment issue and returns
  without permission and interferes is penalised with a direct free kick
  (or penalty kick)

- If the ball rebounds from the goalkeeper this does not prevent the
  goalkeeper handling the ball a second time even if the first attempt to
  catch/hold the ball was deliberate

- If the referee plays advantage for a DOGSO the offender is cautioned (YC)
  whether or not a goal is scored

- A player must stand to take a throw-in (kneeling, sitting etc. not permitted)

## 2017/18

The Law Changes document for this year is [here on page 129. ](https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/laws-of-the-game-2017-18-single-pages?l=en)

- Kicker can stand in the opponents’ half at the kick-off

- Verbal offences are punished with an indirect FK

- If player moves diagonally to pass the last defender/goalkeeper this can still
  be a DOGSO

- A player ‘stopping a promising attack’ in the penalty area is not cautioned
  (YC) if the offence was an attempt to play the ball

## 2016/17

The Law Changes document for the year is [here on 109th PDF page/page 111 on the booklet](https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/laws-of-the-game-2018-19-single-pages?l=en). This was a major re-write of the Laws. The IFAB took a more public role in releasing and maintaining the Laws of the Game. [Here](https://www.theifab.com/news/new-revision-of-the-law-book-to-reduce-controversy-and-confusion-commentary-by-da/) was a press release of the major change by David E.

- Substitutes may take a restart but must first step onto the field

- Clarifies situation when a player is sent off before/after kick-off

- Direct FK (or penalty) if a substitute/team official interferes with play

- If several offences occur at the same time the most serious is punished

- Referee can send a player off from pre-match pitch inspection onwards

- Referee can only use RC + YC after entering the field at start of the match

- If something/someone (other than a player) touches a ball as it goes
  into the goal the referee can award the goal if the touch had no impact on
  the defenders

- Player losing footwear/shinguard accidentally can play on until next
  stoppage

- Halfway line ‘neutral’ for offside; player must be in opponents’ half

- Offside FK always taken where offence occurs (even in own half)

- Foul with contact is a direct FK

- Advantage for a RC – indirect FK if offender then gets involved in play

- Some DOGSO offences in the penalty area are punished with a YC

- Foul off the field penalised with a direct FK on boundary line (penalty in own
  penalty area)
