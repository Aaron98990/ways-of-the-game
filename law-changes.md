This is not an exhaustive list of Law changes - just significant ones. The Laws are updated yearly in July so always be current on it by checking ["Law Changes" on The IFAB's website](https://www.theifab.com/law-changes/latest/). Many participants, especially experienced ones, are not aware of Law Changes. 

The IFAB makes available past Laws of the Game (including the 1903/04 edition) which generally include Law Changes (summary, the before and after text, and explanation) near the end at ["Documents" on The IFAB's website](https://www.theifab.com/documents/?documentType=laws-of-the-game&language=en&years=all).

This is the only place I blatantly insert my opinion. Other places are less blatant.

## 2025/26

[Law changes document.](https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/changes-to-the-laws-of-the-game-2025-26?l=en)

- Indirect free kick and no disciplinary sanction when a team official, substitute, substituted or sent-off player or player who is temporarily off the field of play touches the ball as it is leaving the field of play and there is no intention to interfere unfairly
- A goalkeeper who controls the ball with their hand(s)/arm(s) for more than eight seconds will be penalised with a corner kick
  - Referees to count down with fingers of raised arm the last five seconds of the eight-second restriction on goalkeepers controlling the ball with their hand/arm

## 2024/25

[Law changes document.](https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/lotg_changes_24_25_en?l=en)

- non-deliberate handball offences for which penalties are awarded are to be sanctioned in the same way as fouls which are an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball
- encroachment by players will be penalised only if it has an impact (same philosophy as goalkeeper encroachment)

## 2023/24

[Law changes document.](https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/lotg_changes_23_24_en?l=en)

- Major change of the definition of  ‘deflection’ as related to offside
  - Discussed in [Offside Section](/offside) - I like this change. Should of happened 10 years ago. The old deflection definition favored the attackers too much. We can't punish defenders for defending ([like here](https://youtu.be/Q_Jzpz-b89E?feature=shared&t=8) and [here](https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/pro-explains-decision-allow-jordan-hamiltons-controversial-goal) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5W-bCa-t8Y&ab_channel=MajorLeagueSoccer))
- Clarification for determining the sanction for DOGSO or SPA for an offense that leads to a penalty kick. An attempt to play the ball includes challenging for the ball.
  - A player that charges into the back of an opponent may be attempting to play the ball. Great change! 

## 2022/23

- No major changes.

## 2021/22

[Law changes document.](https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/changes-to-the-laws-of-the-game-2021-22-pdf?l=en)

- To allow some non-violent inappropriate behaviour to be considered ‘offensive, insulting or abusive’ and result in a sending-off, ‘action(s)/acting’ replace ‘gesture(s)/gesturing’ in the relevant descriptions
  - pulling down someone's pants, kicking someone, or slapping someone's butt would fall into this - just don't think "action" is the right word as punching someone - violent conduct is technically an action that is abusive and that may confuse newer referees
- Removal from the accidental attacking handball offense of the references to
  a ‘team-mate’ and ‘creating a goal-scoring opportunity’
  - great change - the accidental attacking handball period was too large. Especially with VAR, many goals were nullified that did not feel right.
- The offense of using a ‘trick’ to circumvent the Law against the goalkeeper handling the ball from a deliberate kick from a team-mate applies at goal kicks; the instigator is to be cautioned (YC)
  - An extension of the 2019/20 Law change of the ball free kicks and goal kicks are always in play when it clearly moves (not needing to leave the penalty area). This caused a lot of confusion at the time.

## 2020/21

[Law changes document.](https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/changes-to-the-laws-of-the-game-2020-21?l=en)

- Yellow cards (YCs) and warnings are not carried forward into penalties
  - I hate this change. One, it's confusing. 2 YC = 1 RC. Everyone knows that. Two, it encourages cheating and disruptive behavior. The rationale they give does not make sense.

## 2019/20

The Law Changes document for the year is [here](https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/changes-to-the-laws-of-the-game-2019-20_en?l=en). It is worth a review since many changes were made.
- Dropped ball – ball dropped for goalkeeper (if play stopped in penalty area) or for one player of team that last touched the ball at the location of the last touch; all other players (of both teams) must be at least 4 m (4.5 yds) away
  - Moving away from the contested dropped ball. I love this change.
- Dropped ball if the ball touches the referee (or other match official) and goes into the goal, possession changes or an attacking move starts
  - I like this. But, I think possession change and an attacking move should be removed as it is too aggressive / an over correction.
- Goalkeeper cannot score by throwing the ball into the opponents’ goal
- If, after a throw-in or deliberate kick from a team-mate, the goalkeeper unsuccessfully kicks or tries to kick the ball to release it into play, the goalkeeper can then handle the ball
  - I like. The "backpass rule" is meant to keep the game flowing not weird goals like this. I have never since a goalkeeper catch the ball after doing this. Please send a video.
- All verbal offenses are punished with an indirect free kick
- For defending team free kicks in their penalty area and all goal kicks, the ball is in play once it is kicked and clearly moves; it does not have to leave the penalty area
- Goalposts, crossbar and nets must not be moving when a penalty is taken and the goalkeeper must not be touching them
- Goalkeeper must have at least part of one foot on, or in line with, the goal line when a penalty kick is taken; cannot stand behind the line
  - For games with VAR this rules is enforced exactly as written. For games without VAR, only blatant offenses are punished. It is super hard for the AR to see this in real-time.
- Once an indirect free kick has been taken, the referee can stop showing the indirect free kick signal if it is clear that a goal cannot be scored directly (e.g. from most offside indirect free kicks)
  - Love it. 
- Referee can delay issuing a YC/RC until the next stoppage if the non-offending
  team takes a quick free kick and creates a goal-scoring opportunity
- If a penalty kick is awarded, the team’s penalty taker can receive assessment
  or treatment and then stay on the field and take the kick
- Referee cannot change a restart decision after play has restarted but a disciplinary sanction may only be issued after play has restarted if another match official had identified and attempted to communicate the offense to the referee before play
  restarted

## 2018/19

The Law Changes document for the year is [here on page 145](https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/laws-of-the-game-2018-19-single-pages?l=en). 

- Player who has left the field because of an equipment issue and returns
  without permission and interferes is penalised with a direct free kick
  (or penalty kick)
- If the ball rebounds from the goalkeeper this does not prevent the
  goalkeeper handling the ball a second time even if the first attempt to
  catch/hold the ball was deliberate
- If the referee plays advantage for a DOGSO the offender is cautioned (YC)
  whether or not a goal is scored
- A player must stand to take a throw-in (kneeling, sitting etc. not permitted)

## 2017/18

The Law Changes document for this year is [here on page 129. ](https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/laws-of-the-game-2017-18-single-pages?l=en)

- Kicker can stand in the opponents’ half at the kick-off
- Verbal offenses are punished with an indirect FK
- If player moves diagonally to pass the last defender/goalkeeper this can still be a DOGSO
- A player ‘stopping a promising attack’ in the penalty area is not cautioned (YC) if the offense was an attempt to play the ball

## 2016/17

The Law Changes document for the year is [here on 109th PDF page/page 111 on the booklet](https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/laws-of-the-game-2018-19-single-pages?l=en). This was a major re-write of the Laws. The IFAB took a more public role in releasing and maintaining the Laws of the Game. [Here](https://www.theifab.com/news/new-revision-of-the-law-book-to-reduce-controversy-and-confusion-commentary-by-da/) was a press release of the major change by David E.

- Substitutes may take a restart but must first step onto the field
- Clarifies situation when a player is sent off before/after kick-off
- Direct FK (or penalty) if a substitute/team official interferes with play
- If several offenses occur at the same time the most serious is punished
- Referee can send a player off from pre-match pitch inspection onwards
- Referee can only use RC + YC after entering the field at start of the match
- If something/someone (other than a player) touches a ball as it goes into the goal the referee can award the goal if the touch had no impact on the defenders
- Player losing footwear/shinguard accidentally can play on until next stoppage
- Halfway line ‘neutral’ for offside; player must be in opponents’ half
- Offside FK always taken where offense occurs (even in own half)
- Foul with contact is a direct FK
- Advantage for a RC – indirect FK if offender then gets involved in play
- Some DOGSO offenses in the penalty area are punished with a YC
- Foul off the field penalised with a direct FK on boundary line (penalty in own penalty area)
- Goalkeeper YC if infringes and PK is retaken
    - "This should encourage goalkeepers not to infringe this Law." was IFAB's reasoning. This was already way to harsh and when VAR was introduced caused more problems as the goalkeeper off the line law was strictly applied rather than just blatant cases. [Women's world cup shootout yellow card dispension was applied.](https://www.si.com/soccer/2019/06/21/womens-world-cup-pk-shootouts-goalkeeper-rule-yellow-card-ifab)
- Kick-off: ball must clearly move to be in play; can be kicked in any direction

## Changes I want

I focus on agreeable changes, not my whacky ones below:

Law 3.7 If a ball is going into the goal and the interference does not prevent a defending player playing the ball, the goal is awarded ~~if the ball enters the goal~~ (even if contact was made with the ball) unless the interference was by the attacking team. (Also, similar change for Law 10.1)
- [The outside agent (spectator) enters the field of play and denies the goal. The restart should be a dropped ball for the goalkeeper under current Laws. The Laws should allow the referee to award an goal here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jaJKgk4g1M)
- [The outside agent (dog) enters the field of play and denies the goal.](https://www.tiktok.com/@refsneedlovetoo/video/7273264932186017066)
- [another one.](https://youtu.be/afhWQumYO24?feature=shared)
- This would apply to a non-players (subs, team officials, etc.) of the defending team and outside agents. Don't come at me with the "purity" of the ball entering the goal. The spectator or non-player of the defending team broke the "purity" of the game by entering the field of play then interfering with play. A RC to a non-player has minimal/no effect on the game and a player can miss a penalty.

Law 3.3 if a player who is to be substituted refuses to leave, play continues **and the team loses a substitution and if applicable, a substitution moment**
- The time is takes for a substitution and associated refusal is the same, and often times longer, than a normal substition and should still be counted as such.

Law 15.1 If the ball touches the ground before entering, the throw-in is retaken by the ~~same~~ *opposing* team from the same position.
- [A player wastes time by forcing a throw-in retake for their team. This is not in the spirit of the game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ6qw5wjrsU)

Law 14.2 If the goalkeeper’s offence results in the kick being retaken, the goalkeeper is warned for the first offence ~~in the game~~ *during a single penalty kick* and cautioned for any subsequent offence(s) ~~in the game~~ *during a single penalty kick*
If the goalkeeper’s offence results in the kick being retaken:
- For the first retake caused by the goalkeeper during a single penalty kick, no discipinary action is taken
- For any subsequent retake caused by the goalkeeper during a single penalty kick, they are cautioned even if the goalkeeper changed


- Harder and more complex for referees to keep track of warnings issued throughout the game esspecially with goalkeeper substitutions. Also, avoids unfairly penalizing goalkeepers who have to defend multipe penalty kicks during a game.

Law 10.3 Before penalties (penalty shoot-out) start: ~~With the exception of a substitute for a goalkeeper who is unable to continue,~~ only players who are on the field of play or are temporarily off the field of play (injury, adjusting equipment etc.) at the end of the match are eligible to take kicks*, unless their team has not used its maximum permitted number of substitutes*
- [Un-needed controversy about subs before penalties.](https://youtu.be/Cl6zluuAiwI?feature=shared&t=1763)
- [Un-needed pause in play and substitution moment near the end of extra time which could of been done right before penalties.](https://youtu.be/C3f7HPIPG0s?feature=shared)
- The reality is most grassroot games have unlimited substitutions and return substitions and even if there is no exception in the competition rules, referees allow anyone to take penalties.

Law 10.3 Substitutions and sendings-off during penalties (penalty shoot-out) The referee must ~~not~~ abandon the match if a team is reduced to fewer than seven players
- I don't understand this Law. If all but one player gets sent-off, that player takes every penalty kick and the opposing team must reduce to one player to take penalties. Also, that many send-offs is not in the spirit of the game.

Law 10.3 ~~warnings and cautions issued to players and team officials during the match are not carried forward into penalties (penalty shoot-out).~~
- 2 YC = 1 RC - it's universal. Just causes too much confusion to fix an issue introduced by VAR. Look below for the important associated change with this.
- [Goalkeeper gets a YC for SPA at 5:25. At 16:24, the goalkeeper gets another YC during penalties. Just look at the chaos and confusion this Law caused in an already tense game. The entire penalties and post-match pushing sequence don't make football look attractive.](https://youtu.be/AF7vLz5UyNM?feature=shared&t=984)

Law 11.4 A defending player who leaves the field of play without the referee’s permission will be considered to be on the goal line or touchline for the purposes of offside until the next stoppage in play or until the ~~defending team has played the ball towards the halfway line and it is outside its penalty area~~ *ball completely leaves that side of the field of play*.
- Too aggressive/over-correction. For accounting for injured players, a more fair balance would be the above.  
- [Offside would of been the correct call as the defender outside the field of play no longer counts for determining the second-to-last defender when the ball is played to the goal scorer by the team-mate by the current Laws. I think its pretty agreeable that no offside feels more right and the changes above would fix that. ](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZPRW7adRp/)


Law 11.4 An attacking player may step or stay off the field of play not to be involved in active play. If the player re-enters from the goal line ~~and becomes involved in play before the next stoppage in play or the defending team has played the ball towards the halfway line and it is outside its penalty area~~, the player will be considered to be positioned on the goal line for the purposes of offside.
- The attacking player doesn't exist anymore if they are off the field of play and the ball goes out of play. Doesn't make sense. We can still punish for deliberately leaving but the attacking player should still be considered on their goal line if they come back in from there. 

*Law 9.1 If the ball touches any non-player or outside agent and was clearly going outside the boundary lines before any player can touch it and the ball was not going into the goal, the restart should be as if the ball had went outside the boundary lines.*
- [The ball hits the assistant referee and may have never left the field of play - either way football expects to treat that as the ball went out of play.](https://youtu.be/N7o-yMLslR0?feature=shared&t=887)
- [The ball hits a substitute before it was about to clearly leave the field of play.](https://youtu.be/83PkzKCCiYo?feature=shared)

Editorial changes are below:

Law 12.2 commits any other offence, not mentioned in the Laws *or where the Laws don't mention a restart*, for which play is stopped to caution or send off a player
- Deceiving the referee (simulation) is mentioned in the Laws (12.3), the Laws just don't give it a restart if there is no contact with an opponent. If the simulation involved contact with a person it is a direct free kick.

Law 12.1 If an offence involves contact *with a person (excluding outside agents)*, it is penalised by a direct free kick.
- Just to make it clear that it is not contact with the ball. 

Law 12.2 An indirect free kick is awarded if a player: prevents the *opposing* goalkeeper from releasing the ball from the hands or kicks or attempts to kick the ball when the *opposing* goalkeeper is in the process of releasing it
- Small fix. 

Interpretations or competition rules are below:

Guidelines for Match Officials: If the goalkeeper blatantly moves off the goal line before the ball is kicked and prevents a goal from being scored, the AR should indicate the encroachment ~~according to the pre-match instructions from the referee~~ *by raising their flag*.
- This is never discussed. Just put it in the Guidlines as this is the most used and won't confuse new referees.

Guidelines for Match Officials: If there is no fourth official *and there are a limited number of substitutions*, the AR moves to the halfway line to assist with the substitution procedure; the referee must wait until the AR is back in position before restarting play. [Similar change to following paragraph]
- Most grassroot games have unlimited substitions and an assistant referee moving constantly back and fourth is a waste of time.

Guidelines for Match Officals: [Remove "Goalkeeper releasing the ball" and "goal kick" section including the associated diagrams]
- An assistant referee should not be hunting for a handball while the goalkeeper releasing the ball as mentioned in "spirit in the game" and most assistant referees (including FIFA referees) don't follow that advice. Same for goal kick. Why should an assistant referee care about the ball being a foot away from the goal area? It makes no difference.

Competition Rule Gripe: American sports will have the player's number on more than one side of the jersey but soccer teams generally only have one jersey number. It makes it hard to identify players.
