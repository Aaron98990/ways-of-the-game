Being technically correct is not always in the "spirit of the game". It is the equivalent of giving a ticket for someone going 1 mph over the speed limit - yes they broke the law but they did not make anyone less safe. That same logic applies to refereeing. 

Many people call this Law 18 or Common Sense or Trifling or Tradition. This subjectivity is a blessing and a curse.

These are common "spirit of the game" moments. There are no hard and fast guidlines on what the "spirit of the game" is but I divided these into three sections: Commonly Accepted, Subjective, and Not Commonly Acceptable.

## Commonly Accepted

Windy conditions mean that a ball can't be stationary on the ground althugh the restart requires the ball to be stationary.

- There is no benefit if a free kick or goal kick is not stationary when kicked. After explaining the situation to the teams, the referee should allow play to continue.

Undershirt color matching shirt sleeve, undershorts/tights matching short color, tape on socks matching sock color

- For lower levels of football, there is no need to strictly apply this rule unless it creates an unfair advantage or distraction to opponents. 

A ball is about to clearly go outside the field of play but a non-player touches it. 

- Restart play as if the non-player did not touch the ball and the ball went out. If the ball is not clearly going outside the field of play, the referee should punish the offense as described in the Laws of the Game.

For lower levels of football, skipping the coin toss to save time is okay.

- Esspecially with back to back games, the referee may just choose sides or who kick-offs.

A team had limited or no subs. The opposing team has a full roster. During a cooling break (water break), the team with the full roster wants to restart earlier. 

- To allow the teams with limited or no subs to fully recover, it is fair to go through the full water break. 

Not playing any additional time in second half in a blowout game, esspecially when there is extreme weather conditions.

- If the players from both teams clearly want the game to end, there is no need to play additional time.

Not forcing a retake of a penalty kick because the goalkeeper was off their line but the ball was kicked right down the middle and being off the line caused no advantage.

- The goalkeeper did not gain any advantage - the goalkeeper would of caught the ball if they were on the goal line or not. 

Not penalizing encroachment by an attacker or defender who does not directly become involved in play and.

- The penalty kick law is not meant to be strictly read. If the ball enters the goal or completely misses the goal, the encroachment by one yard does not change anything and does not need to be penalized.

Not penalizing a goalkeeper when they are releasing the ball and are handling the ball less than one yeard outside the penalty area.

- As the benefit is minimal and the restart is very benefical for the opponents, giving a warning to the goalkeeper before panlizing this would be the best action.

Throw ins, free kicks are not taken at the exact point.

- Allowing a couple of yards from the spot of the offense or where the ball left the field of play is fine as long as no team gains an unfair advantage.

If a player only has one arm, allow them to take the throw-in with their one arm.

- While the Laws of the Game require two arms, there is no clear advantage with throwing the ball with one arm. Allow it.

The goalkeeper goes to retrieve the ball, the referee should hold play until the goalkeeper returns. [The referees disallow a goal because they started play while the goalkeeper was retrieving a ball (2 whistle).](https://youtu.be/dZU1x2Op9pA?t=433)

- For lower levels of football, this is acceptable as the goalkeeper may not understand the tactical advantage they are giving the other team or there may not be enough people to reteieve balls.

A goalkeeper deliberately allows the ball to rebound off their hands which they could have wasily caught.

- Warn the goalkeeper once. If it happens again, penalize it. Some referees are inconsistent on calling this so calling this the first time would be unfair.

Allowing all players, including the goalkeeper, to be ready for a kickoff after celebrating a goal.

- It is the fair thing to do.

A player playing on a multi-line field takes the throw-in from the wrong line.

- Allow the player to retake the throw-in from the correct line. If it happens again to the same team, penalize the offence as accoring to the Laws of the Game.

The referee only allows a player to re-enter the field if they cannot immediatly intefere with play.

- Although not explicitally stated, this is the most fairest thing.

When to end the game although time is up.

- Referees do not end a half during a promising attack or if the ball is about to go in the goal as this is seen as the fairest for both teams.

A player forgot to bring their red jersey to the game so they wear their pink shirt instead that does not have a number.

- For lower levels of the game, this is acceptable as the main purpose is to have fun and exercise.

A coach enters the field of play without hte referee's permission during an altercations to calm their players.

- While the coach may have illegally entered the field and technically could be shown a cuation, their intention was to calm their players down and showing a caution would be harsh.

## Subjective

Disallowing a goal for kneeling down on the ground to showboat while scoring.

- Some referees deem this as unsporting behavior. It's not wrong. Personally, I would allow the goal to stand. 

Stopping play for an injury - forcing teammates/opponents to kick it out.

- Players faking injuries to waste time is common so referees must balance the risk of injury to fairness to the game. At lower levels of the game, stopping the game quicker would be more appropiate. At higher levels of the game, referees do not stop play for minor injurues.

Showing a yellow card for showboating with the ball. [Controversy: player punished for showboating - Sipho Moeti - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd6eLQbu9vM)

- Some referees deem this as unsporting behavior. It's not wrong as a retaliation foul would be common after showboating like that. Personally, I would allow the play to continue.

Legally kicking the ball far away outside the field while the ball is in play for no tactical reason other than to waste time.

- For lower levels of football where the number of balls are limited and the main purpose is to have fun, I would show a yellow card or unsporting behavior. 

Ending the game on a corner kick during a close game. [2011 FIFA Women's World Cup Extra Time Ends on a Corner Kick](https://youtu.be/UAbX7wld9vg?t=8189)

- If time is up and the ball is not about to enter the goal and their is no promising attack, there is no need to play through an a corner. Not everyone would agree.

## Not Commonly Acceptable

Allowing jewlery because you expect the game not to be aggressive.

- The game is physcial and the referee's main responsibility is to keep the player's from getting injured from avoidable hazards. 

Ignoring a handball because the ball bareley grazes a defender's arm.

- A handball offense should always be penalized as it will affect the trajectory and curve of the ball. 

Not using cards in a "friendly", "scrimmage", or pre-season game.

- Cards are the main way for a referee to control a game. Referees are not like coaches who have other ways to punish non-desirable behavior from players. From my experience, pre-season games are more aggressive than regular season games as coaches choose to play against teams that are at a similar skill level and players want to prove themselves early on the season.

The throw-in taker has both feet in front of the touchline but the impact / advantage is minimal.

- The Law is very simple. Penalize the offense as described in the Laws by letting the other team take the throw-in. Explain it to the player and they will never make the mistake again.

A player on the losing team commits DOGSO outside the penalty area in a blowout game. It was an attempt at the ball - ignore the red card and give a yellow card.

- The player should be punished as stated in the Laws of the Game. Not penalizing offenses emboldens other players to foul more and lessens the referee's authority.

Denying a substitution for time-waasting.

- The referee should not deny a legal substitution request - even if the main purpose is to waste time. Adding more time to the half would be acceptable. In games with unlimited substitutions, denying a substitution that is cleary time wasting is acceptable.

Not giving a second yellow card for removing one's shirt during a goal celebration because it is harsh.

- The Law is very clear here. A player does not accidently remove their shirt. The referee should give the second yellow card as that is what the Law requires. [Wprld Cup Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsRFCq6rFT4)
