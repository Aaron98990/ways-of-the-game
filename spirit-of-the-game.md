Being technically correct is not always in the "spirit of the game". It is the equivalent of giving a ticket for someone going 1 mph over the speed limit - yes they broke the law but they did not make anyone less safe. That same logic applies to refereeing. 

Many people call this Law 18, Common Sense, Trifling, Tradition or "in the opinion of the referee". This subjectivity is a blessing and a curse.

These are common "spirit of the game" moments. There are no hard and fast guidelines on what the "spirit of the game" is but I divided these into three sections: Commonly Accepted, Subjective, and Not Commonly Acceptable.

## Commonly Accepted

Windy conditions mean that a ball can't be stationary on the ground although the restart requires the ball to be stationary.
- There is no benefit if a free kick or goal kick is not stationary when kicked. After explaining the situation to the teams, the referee should allow play to continue.
- [Although the ball is not on the field of play and not stationary when kicked, due to the windy conditions I would allow it as it in the spirit of the game.](https://www.tiktok.com/@refsneedlovetoo/video/7262071167090003242)

A goal kick is taken a couple of feet from the goal area, the ball is not completely stationary during a goal kick, on a kick-off a player enters their opponent's side before the ball is in play but does not become involved in play.
- Redoing the restart in the instances above are technically correct, but to who's benefit? Unless the goal kick is being taken quickly and to catch opponent's off guard, I would let play continue.

The ball goes above the goal and out of play after a deflection from a defender. The point where the ball passed over the goal line was closer to the left corner area but the ball bounces closer to the right corner area.
- Although forcing the restart from the left corner area is technically correct, the ball is already closer to the right corner area. Whatever the referee decides, they must be consistent on this throughout the match.

Undershirt color matching shirt sleeve, undershorts/tights matching short color, tape on socks matching sock color, non-goalkeeper not suppose to be wearing tracksuit bottoms, players offending by wearing sleeveless shirts, player offending by wearing non-sport spectacles
- For lower levels of football, there is no need to strictly apply these Laws unless it creates an unfair advantage or distraction to opponents or it is not safe.

Corner flags are missing, the lines are not straight, the penalty area is not the proper size, or the goals are not the proper size. No penalty mark for penalty kicks.
- For lower levels of football, play with what you are given. Use the lines as drawn (even incorrectly) on the field of play. If the penalty mark is missing, count 12 yards from the goal line to place the ball when a penalty kick is given.

A ball is about to clearly go outside the field of play but a non-player touches it. 
- Restart play as if the non-player did not touch the ball and the ball went out. If the ball is not clearly going outside the field of play, the referee should punish the offense as described in the Laws of the Game.
- [A sub touches the ball before it goes out of play and a penalty kick is awarded. Although technically correct, this is against the spirit of the game to call this as  no team gains an unfair advantage.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83PkzKCCiYo)

For lower levels of football, skipping the coin toss to save time is okay, having the assistant referee do the coin toss, or using a different method to determine sides/kick-off when no one has a coin.
- Especially with back to back games or behind schedule games, the referee may just choose sides or who kick-offs. Although against the Laws, if an assistant referee is doing the coin toss to save time - no one will throw a fit. And in lower levels of the game if no one has coin and they use the guess if one or two fingers are behind, that is fine.

A team had limited or no subs. The opposing team has a full roster. The team with the full roster wants no cooling break (water break) or a shorter drinks break (water break) or a shorter half-time interval.
- To allow the teams with limited or no subs to fully recover and for their safety, it is fair to go through with the full cooling break (water break) or water break interval. There is no requirement that both teams must agree to a water break. A referee may take a water break for themselves even if both teams don't one.

Not playing any additional time in second half in a blowout game, especially when there is extreme weather conditions.
- If the players from both teams clearly want the game to end, there is no need to play additional time. Shortening the half may even be acceptable in lower levels of the game.

Not forcing a retake of a penalty kick because the goalkeeper was off their line but the ball was kicked right down the middle and being off the line caused no advantage.
- The goalkeeper did not gain any advantage - the goalkeeper would of caught the ball if they were on the goal line or not. 

Not penalizing encroachment by an attacker or defender who does not directly become involved in play.
- The penalty kick law is not meant to be strictly read. If the ball enters the goal or completely misses the goal, the encroachment by one yard does not change anything and does not need to be penalized.

Not penalizing a goalkeeper when they are releasing the ball and are handling the ball less than one yard outside the penalty area.
- As the benefit is minimal and the direct free kick restart is very beneficial for the opponents, giving a warning to the goalkeeper before penalizing this would be the best action.

Throw ins, free kicks are not taken at the exact point.
- Allowing a couple of yards from the spot of the offense or where the ball left the field of play is fine if no team gains an unfair advantage.

If a player only has one arm, allow them to take the throw-in with their one arm.
- While the Laws of the Game require two hands, there is no clear advantage with throwing the ball with one arm. Allow it.

The goalkeeper goes to retrieve the ball, the referee should hold play until the goalkeeper returns. 
- [The match officials disallow a goal because they started play while the goalkeeper was retrieving a ball.](https://youtu.be/dZU1x2Op9pA?t=433)
- For lower levels of football, this is acceptable as the goalkeeper may not understand the tactical advantage they are giving the other team or there may not be enough people to retrieve balls.

Allowing all players, including the goalkeeper, to be ready for a kickoff after celebrating a goal.
- It is the fair thing to do.

A player playing on a multi-sport field takes the throw-in from the wrong line.
- Allow the player to retake the throw-in from the correct line. If it happens again to the same team, penalize the offense as according to the Laws of the Game.

The referee only allows a player to re-enter the field if they cannot immediately interfere with play.
- Although not explicitly stated, this is the fairest thing.

When to end the game although time is up.
- Referees do not end a half during a promising attack during a close game or if the ball is about to go in the goal as this is seen as the fairest for both teams.

A player forgot to bring their red jersey to the game so they wear their pink shirt instead that does not have a number.
- For lower levels of the game, this is acceptable as the main purpose is to have fun and exercise.

There is no need to kick the ball out for an injured player.
- No one is obligated to kick the ball out of play for an injured player. The referee will stop play if they deem it serious.

## Subjective

Disallowing a goal for kneeling down on the ground to showboat while scoring.
- Some referees deem this as unsporting behavior. It's not wrong. Personally, I would allow the goal to stand. 

Showing a yellow card for showboating with the ball. 
- [Controversy: player punished for showboating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd6eLQbu9vM)
- Some referees deem this as unsporting behavior. It's not wrong as a retaliation foul would be common after showboating like that. Personally, I would allow the play to continue.

Legally kicking the ball far away outside the field while the ball is in play for no tactical reason other than to waste time.
- For lower levels of football where the number of balls are limited and the main purpose is to have fun, I would show a yellow card or unsporting behavior. 

Ending the game on a corner kick during a close game. 
- If time is up and the ball is not about to enter the goal and their is no promising attack in a close game, there is no need to play through an a corner. Not everyone would agree.
- [2011 FIFA Women's World Cup Extra Time Ends on a Corner Kick](https://youtu.be/UAbX7wld9vg?t=8189)

Denying a substitution for time-wasting when there are unlimited return substitutions.
- Denying a substitution that is clearly time wasting may be acceptable, especially for games where competition rules mandate no added time.

Letting teams go over the maximum number of substitutions or re-entries (return substitutions) if both teams agree or for weather conditions. Also, letting teams leave the field of play when there are a limited number of substitutions during the water break/between first and second half of extra time if both teams agree or for weather conditions.
- Competition organizers may give a forfeit for a game where the substitution procedures are not followed. If players leave the field of play for a water break/between first and second half of extra time, it is the honor system for who comes back on to the field of play. The referee must use their best judgement.

A player on the losing team commits DOGSO outside the penalty area in a blowout game. It was an attempt at the ball - ignore the red card and give a yellow card.
- For lower levels of the game, this may be acceptable as the main intent is to have fun. But any foul that is reckless or uses excessive force should be sanctioned no mattered the scoreline or level of the game. Not properly sanctioning reckless/excessive force fouls emboldens other players to foul more and lessens the referee's authority.

## Not Commonly Acceptable

Allowing jewelry because you expect the game not to be aggressive.
- The game is physical and the referee's main responsibility is to keep the player's from getting injured from avoidable hazards. For games with small children (under 10) you may be able to get away with this.

Ignoring a handball because the ball barely grazes a defender's arm.
- A handball offense should always be penalized as it will affect the trajectory and curve of the ball. 

Not using cards in a "friendly", "scrimmage", or pre-season game.
- Cards are the main way for a referee to control a game. Referees are not like coaches who have other ways to punish non-desirable behavior from players. From my experience, pre-season games are more aggressive than regular season games as coaches choose to play against teams that are at a similar skill level and players want to prove themselves early on the season.

Not giving a second yellow card for removing one's shirt during a goal celebration because it is harsh.
- A player does not accidentally remove their shirt - they know what they are doing.
- [World Cup Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsRFCq6rFT4)

> Q: If a Referee cautions a player who in turn apologises for his misconduct, can the Referee omit to report the incident?
>
> A. No, all cautions must be reported. 1970/71 Laws of the Game

- A referee can't omit a caution or send-off from their match report because of an apology. A referee could of used their discretion before the caution or send-off.

Not awarding a clear penalty kick or red card (including second yellow card) because you don't want the game decided like that.

- Not awarding a penalty kick or red card you are not 100% sure about is acceptable. But, when it's 100% clear the choice is not in your hands.
