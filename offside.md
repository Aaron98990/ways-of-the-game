## Never offside

> There is no offside offence if a player receives the ball directly from:
>
> - a goal kick
>
> - a throw-in
>
> - a corner kick

So, if the ball goes over and past the goal line or touchline - there can never be offside from the restart.

Video example 1

> A player is in an offside position if:
> 
> - any part of the head, body or feet is in the opponents’ half (excluding the halfway line)

So, if your completely your own half, can never be offside.

Video example 2

> A player in an offside position receiving the ball from an opponent who deliberately played* the ball, including by deliberate handball, is not considered to have gained an advantage, unless it was a deliberate save by any opponent.

So, if the ball is deliberately passed to you by an opponent you can never be offside.

Video example three

> A player is in an offside position if:
>
> - any part of the head, body or feet is nearer to the opponents’ goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent

If you are behind or even with the ball when it is touched by a teammate, you are never offside.

Video example 4

If you are behind or even with the second-to-last defender when the ball is touched by a teammate, you are never offside. Remember, the goalkeeper counts as a defender.

## Close Calls

Just because a player recieves the ball ahead of everyone does not necessairly mean they are offside.

In Circular no. 26 and the 2023/2024 Laws of the Game , The IFAB released a major interpretation change to whether a touch of the ball should be determined as a deflection or not. [The IFAB released 15 video examples of whether a touch of the ball should be determined as a deflection or non-deflection.](https://www.theifab.com/news/law-11-offside-deliberate-play-guidelines-clarified/)

The changes comes down to this - It is not a deflection and it is deliberate play if the defender played the ball to where they wanted or should of been able to.

It is subjective and could be interpeted differently in the diferent levels of thte game.

## Ball off the goalpost or crossbar

> - gaining an advantage by playing the ball or interfering with an opponent

> Lae 11 - Offside

## Deliberate save

A save is later defined in the Laws of the Game. Please note that a save can be done by any opponent including a non-goalkeeper player. The save does not need to involve using the hands/arms.

> A ‘save’ is when a player stops, or attempts to stop, a ball which is going into or very close to the goal with any part of the body except the hands/arms (unless the goalkeeper within the penalty area).

Don't overthink the definition. Just think to yourself did the opponent block the ball (e.g. from a cross with some distance from the goal) or did the opponent save the ball (e.g. a shot towards goal or a cross very close to the goal)

## Intefering with an Opponent

> If an attacking player remains stationary between the goalposts and inside the goal as the ball enters the goal, a goal must be awarded unless the player commits an offside offence or a Law 12 offence
> 
> Law 11
