In Circular no. 26 and the 2023/2024 Laws of the Game , The IFAB released a major interpretation change to whether a touch of the ball should be determined as a deflection or not. [The IFAB released 15 video examples of whether a touch of the ball should be determined as a deflection or non-deflection.](https://www.theifab.com/news/law-11-offside-deliberate-play-guidelines-clarified/)

The changes comes down to this - It is not a deflection and it is deliberate play if the defender played the ball to where they wanted or should of been able to.

It is subjective and could be interpeted differently in the diferent levels of thte game.

## Deliberate save

A save is later defined in the Laws of the Game. Please note that a save can be done by any opponent including a non-goalkeeper player. The save does not need to involve using the hands/arms.

> A ‘save’ is when a player stops, or attempts to stop, a ball which is going into or very close to the goal with any part of the body except the hands/arms (unless the goalkeeper within the penalty area).

Don't overthink the definition. Just think to yourself did the opponent block the ball (e.g. from a cross with some distance from the goal) or did the opponent save the ball (e.g. a shot towards goal or a cross very close to the goal)

## Intefering with an Opponent

> If an attacking player remains stationary between the goalposts and inside the goal as the ball enters the goal, a goal must be awarded unless the player commits an offside offence or a Law 12 offence
