## Never offside

> There is no offside offence if a player receives the ball directly from:
> - a goal kick
> - a throw-in
> - a corner kick

So, if the ball goes out of play from the touchline or goalline and no goal is scored - there can never be offside from the restart.

> A player is in an offside position if:
> 
> - any part of the head, body or feet is in the opponents’ half (excluding the halfway line)

So, if your completely your own half when the ball is touched by a team-mate, can never be offside.

> A player in an offside position receiving the ball from an opponent who deliberately played* the ball, including by deliberate handball, is not considered to have gained an advantage, unless it was a deliberate save by any opponent.

So, if the ball is deliberately played (I prefer calling it a non-deflection) by an opponent and you directly get it you can never be offside. We review less clear examples in the "deflection" section below.

> A player is in an offside position if:
>
> - any part of the head, body or feet is nearer to the opponents’ goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent

If you are behind or even with the ball when it is touched by a team-mate, you are never offside. (The direction of the pass is irrelavnt. )

[No offside. Although they are in an offside position, the player is behind the ball when played by a team-mate. ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=113&v=U01-uArNpdw&feature=youtu.be)

If you are behind or even with the second-to-last defender when the ball is touched by a teammate, you are never offside. Remember, the goalkeeper counts as a defender.

## Close Calls

Just because a player recieves the ball ahead of everyone does not necessairly mean they are offside.

## Offside then not

When a player recieves a ball, they may not be in an offside position anymore. This does not negate the fact that they were offside position when the ball was touched by a team-mate. 

[Video of off then not]

As a matter of fact if they are in an offside position and touch the ball on their team's side of the field, the restart will be on the player's own half. Players will be grumpy about this but it is the correct call.

> If an offside offence occurs, the referee awards an indirect free kick where the offence occurred, including if it is in the player’s own half of the field of play.

## Deflection

In Circular no. 26 and the 2023/24 Laws of the Game , The IFAB released a major change to whether a touch of the ball should be determined as a deflection or not. [The IFAB released 15 video examples of whether a touch of the ball should be determined as a deflection or non-deflection.](https://www.theifab.com/news/law-11-offside-deliberate-play-guidelines-clarified/)

The changes comes down to this -  if the defender played the ball to where they wanted to or should of been able to.

A player can deliberately attempt to block or play the ball, but still can be a deflection for purposes of offside. That's why I prefer to use non-deflection rather than deliberate play - it causes too much confusion. 

[Offside. Although the defender deliberalty moves towards the ball, the touch by the defender is considered a deflection since they did not have enough time to react.](https://youtu.be/isgWI1hpWuI?t=506)

It is subjective and could be interpeted differently by different people. The level of the game would affect this decision.

## Ball off the goalpost or crossbar

## Deliberate save

A save is later defined in the Laws of the Game. Please note that a save can be done by any opponent including a non-goalkeeper player. The save does not need to involve using the hands/arms.

> A ‘save’ is when a player stops, or attempts to stop, a ball which is going into or very close to the goal with any part of the body except the hands/arms (unless the goalkeeper within the penalty area).

Don't overthink the definition. Just think to yourself did the opponent block the ball (e.g. from a cross with some distance from the goal) or did the opponent save the ball (e.g. a shot towards goal or a cross very close to the goal)

## Intefering with an Opponent
The intefering with an opponent must meet one of these criteria. If not, it is not considered intefering with an opponent by the Laws.
> - (1) preventing an opponent from playing or being able to play the ball by clearly obstructing the opponent’s line of vision or
>
> - (2) challenging an opponent for the ball or
>
> - (3) clearly attempting to play a ball which is close when this action impacts on an opponent or
> 
> - (4) making an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball

PRO has an amazing write up on intefering with an opponent.
