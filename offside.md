## Never offside

> There is no offside offense if a player receives the ball directly from:
> - a goal kick
> - a throw-in
> - a corner kick

So, no offside on the above restarts. A goalkeeper releasing the ball after control with the hands is not a goal kick and offside can be called. 

[No offside. There is never offside when ball received directly from a throw-in. ](https://youtu.be/4C961hfCY6I?t=21)

> A player is in an offside position if:
> - any part of the head, body or feet is in the opponents’ half (excluding the halfway line) and
> - any part of the head, body or feet is nearer to the opponents’ goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent

 So, if your completely your own half when the ball is touched by a team-mate, can never be offside.

[No offside. The player is in their own half when touched by a team-mate.](https://youtu.be/-pv5yvd7FZk?feature=shared&t=1182)

If you are behind or even with the ball when it is touched by a team-mate, you are never offside. (The direction of the pass is irrelevant.)

[No offside. Although they are ahead of the second-last opponent, the player is behind the ball when played by a team-mate. ](https://youtube.com/watch?t=119&v=U01-uArNpdw&feature=youtu.be)

If you are behind or even with the second-to-last defender when the ball is touched by a teammate, you are never offside. Remember, the goalkeeper counts as a defender.

- [No offside. The player with the assist in their run-up, is in line with the second-to-last defender when played by a team-mate. The player that scores is behind the ball when played by a team-mate. ](https://youtu.be/d9gU6kmlagI)
- [Offside. The player that scores the goal is behind only one defender when the ball is passed to them by a team-mate.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMzL2Uym5Ak&t=18)

> A player in an offside position receiving the ball from an opponent who deliberately played* the ball, including by deliberate handball, is not considered to have gained an advantage, unless it was a deliberate save by any opponent.

So, if the ball is deliberately played (not deflected) by an opponent who is not near the goal you can never be offside. We review less clear examples in the "deflection" section below.

[No offside. The ball is played by an opponent and the play wasn't a deflection. The referee always makes the final decision. ](https://youtu.be/beFY-IF6ahQ?t=13s)

## Summary

> It is not an offence to be in an offside position.

Offside offense:
- Offside position when the ball is touched by a team-mate and
- ball not directly from goal kick, throw-in, or corner kick and
- becoming involved in active play

Offside position:
- in opponent's half of the field and
- ahead of ball and second-last defender
- player off the the field of play has some exceptions

Active Play:
- [1a] touching/playing the ball or
- [2a] interfering with an opponent or
- gaining an advantage by [1a] or [2a] after:
  - deflection by opponent or
  - ball off the goalpost or crossbar or match offical or
  - deliberate save

## Close Calls

Just because a player receives the ball ahead of everyone does not necessarily mean they are offside.

## Offside then not

When a player receives a ball, they may not be in an offside position anymore. This does not negate the fact that they were offside position when the ball was touched by a team-mate. 

[TODO - Video of off then not]

As a matter of fact if they are in an offside position and touch the ball on their team's side of the field, the restart will be on the player's own half. Players will be grumpy about this but it is the correct call.

> If an offside offense occurs, the referee awards an indirect free kick where the offense occurred, including if it is in the player’s own half of the field of play.

[TODO - Video of restart from offside in offender's own half. ]

## Interfering with an opponent
A player does not have to touch the ball to commit an offside offense. The interfering with an opponent must meet at least one of the four these criteria. If not, it is not considered interfering with an opponent by the Laws.
> - [1] preventing an opponent from playing or being able to play the ball by clearly obstructing the opponent’s line of vision or
> - [2] challenging an opponent for the ball or
> - [3] clearly attempting to play a ball which is close when this action impacts on an opponent or
> - [4] making an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball

- [Offside. A player in an offside position moves into the path of an opponent who is going towards the ball. This meets criteria (4).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbfasuv9z8) Click [here](https://proreferees.com/2017/08/02/play-of-the-week-21-interfering-with-an-opponent/) for PRO's full write up.
- [Not offside. The player in an offside position is not challenging an opponent (not 3) and the goalkeeper has no chance to play the ball after the delection (not 1 or 2 or 4).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aG9TN_GCAbs)
- [Not offside. The player in the offside position does not touch the ball or interfere with an opponent.](https://youtu.be/svs8ZH0gBgE?t=108)
- [Offside. The goalkeeper kicks the ball out of play because of the attacker (3,4)](https://youtu.be/D-mcLd3GAPc?feature=shared&t=128)

> If an attacking player remains stationary between the goalposts and inside the goal as the ball enters the goal, a goal must be awarded unless the player commits an offside offense or a Law 12 offense

> Law 11

## Deflection

A deflection does not reset offside.

> A player in an offside position at the moment the ball is played or touched by a
> team-mate is only penalised on becoming involved in active play by:
>  (…)
> 
> - gaining an advantage by playing the ball or interfering with an opponent

> 
> Lae 11 - Offside

In Circular no. 26 and the 2023/24 Laws of the Game, IFAB released a major change to whether a touch of the ball should be determined as a deflection or not. Many examples about deflection / deliberate play before 2023 will be wrong since they use outdated deflection interpretation.

The changes comes down to this -  it's not a deflection (deliberate play) for offside if the defender played the ball to where they wanted to or should of been able to.

A defender can deliberately attempt to block or play the ball (including moving towards the ball), but still can be a deflection for purposes of offside. That's why I prefer to use non-deflection rather than deliberate play - it causes too much confusion. 

- [MUST WATCH! The IFAB released 15 video examples of whether a touch of the ball should be determined as a deflection or not for offside.](https://www.theifab.com/news/law-11-offside-deliberate-play-guidelines-clarified/).
- [Offside. Although the defender deliberately moves towards the ball, the touch by the defender is considered a deflection since they did not "played the ball to where they wanted to or should of been able to" because they did not have enough time to react.](https://youtu.be/isgWI1hpWuI?t=506)
- [Offside. The defender did not have enough time to react so this is a deflection. This was the correct call back in 2015 but now this would be a wrong call.](https://youtu.be/YhRDRvl2cTk?feature=shared&t=13)
- [Offside. This is a unique situation as the Laws say the chesting is a deliberate play and therefore offside resets.](https://youtu.be/a9bc40IUkhM?feature=shared&t=487) But, IFAB clarified this [here](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/13855042/offside-rule-change-manchester-city-bernardo-silva/) saying to wait until a pass, shot, or start dribbling before offside resets.


It is subjective and could be interpreted differently by different people. The level of the game would affect this decision.

## Ball off the goalpost or crossbar

A ball off the goalpost or crossbar does not reset offside.

> A player in an offside position at the moment the ball is played or touched by a
> team-mate is only penalised on becoming involved in active play by:
>  - (…)
> - gaining an advantage by playing the ball or interfering with an opponent
>   when it has:
>   - **rebounded or been deflected off the goalpost, crossbar**, match official or
>     an opponent
> 
> Lae 11 - Offside

## Deliberate save

A deliberate save does not reset offside.

> A player in an offside position at the moment the ball is played or touched by a
> team-mate is only penalised on becoming involved in active play by:
>  (…)
> - gaining an advantage by playing the ball or interfering with an opponent
>   when it has:
>   - been deliberately saved by any opponent
> 
> Lae 11 - Offside

> A ‘save’ is when a player stops, or attempts to stop, a ball which is going into or very close to the goal with any part of the body except the hands/arms (unless the goalkeeper within the penalty area).

A save can be done by any opponent and not just the goalkeeper. The save does not need to use the hands/arms. Don't overthink the definition. Just think to yourself did the opponent block the ball (e.g. from a cross with some distance from the goal) or did the opponent save the ball (e.g. a shot towards goal or a cross very close to the goal)

[Offside. A player is in an offside position when touched by the team-mate. The goalkeeper makes a deliberate save which means that offside is not reset. The player in the offside position then challenges for the for ball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCJHXMxxyBk&ab_channel=NottinghamshireFA)


## Player outside the field of play

> A defending [or attacking] player who leaves the field of play without the referee’s permission will be considered to be on the goal line or touchline for the purposes of offside until the next stoppage in play or until the defending team has played the ball towards the halfway line and it is outside its penalty area. Law 11.4

- [A player slips and remains off the field of play. That player is considered on the goal line and keeps the player that interferes with the goalkeeper onside. The defending team played the ball towards the halfway line (the guy who slipped) but that play did not cause the ball to exit the penalty area.](https://youtu.be/eyKa-xvHDQA?feature=shared&t=489)
- [Not offside. An attacking player's momentum takes them off the field of play and he is considered on the goal line. But, two defenders are also on the goal line meaning that the attacking player can't be offside.](https://www.tiktok.com/@refsneedlovetoo/video/7259435507837406506)
- [Offside. A defender stays off the field of play and he is considered on the goal line. But, the ball is played by a defender toward the halfway line and out of the penalty area so at this point the defender does not count for offside purposes. The player who touches the ball before the goal should of been called offside. ](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZPRW7adRp/)
- [Offside. The attacker is off the field of play and is considered on the goal line when the ball is played by a team-mate making him in an offside position. He then interferes with an opponent by the challenging an opponet for the ball (2) after a deliberate save near the goal line near a defender.](https://youtu.be/eyKa-xvHDQA?feature=shared&t=489)

## Assistant referees
> The AR must be in line with the second-last defender or the ball if it is nearer to the goal line than the second-last defender. The AR must always face the field of play, even when running.

> The first action of the AR for an offside decision is to raise the flag (using the right hand, giving the AR a better line of vision) and then, if the referee stops play, use the flag to indicate the area of the field of play in which the offence occurred [until the ball is in the correct position]. If the flag is not immediately seen by the referee, the AR must maintain the signal until it has been acknowledged or the ball is clearly in the control of the defending team.
