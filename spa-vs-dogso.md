> ### Denying a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity (DOGSO)
> 
> Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball; in all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling, pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.), the offending player must be sent off.
> 
> Where a player denies the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by a handball offence, the player is sent off wherever the offence occurs (except a goalkeeper within their penalty area).
> 
> A player, sent-off player, substitute or substituted player who enters the field of play without the required referee’s permission and interferes with play or an opponent and denies the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity is guilty of a sending-off offence.
> 
> The following must be considered:
> 
> - distance between the offence and the goal
> 
> - general direction of the play
> 
> - likelihood of keeping or gaining control of the ball
> 
> - location and number of defenders
> 
> Law 12.3 Direct Free Kick

Generally, referees require that all four considerations to be required for DOGSO to be met but it is not a requirement. 

Stopping a Promising Attack is not defned in the Laws of the Game but generally commiting a foul with the main purpose to stop a player from advancing would qualify. 

## Disciplinary Action

> There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour including if a player:
> 
> - handles the ball to interfere with or stop a promising attack
> 
> - commits any other offence which interferes with or stops a promising attack, except where the referee awards a penalty kick for an offence which was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball
> 
> - denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by committing an offence which was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball and the referee awards a penalty kick
> 
> Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

> A player, substitute or substituted player who commits any of the following offences is sent off:
> 
> - denying the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by a handball offence (except a goalkeeper within their penalty area)
> 
> - denying a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity to an opponent whose overall movement is towards the offender’s goal by an offence punishable by a free kick
> 
> Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

Please note that DOGSO applies to "an offense punishable by a free kick". This means that indirect free kick offenses and direct free kick offenses can lead to a red card for DOGSO.

[The referee should of had the goalkick retaken as the goalkeeper was just setting the ball. Ignoring that, the goalkeeper plays the goalkick twice denying the opponent a clear goal scoring opportunity. Although, the restart is an indrect free kick the offendor is sent off.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uivLc9urdBY)

| **In penalty area**     | Attempt for the ball:  no card          | Attempt for the ball:  YC               |
|                         | No attempt for the ball or handball: YC | No attempt for the ball or handball: RC |
| **Out of penalty area** | YC                                      | RC                                      |

## If Advantage is played

> If the referee plays the advantage for an offence for which a caution/sending-off would have been issued had play been stopped, this caution/sending-off must be issued when the ball is next out of play. However, if the offence was denying the opposing team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity the player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour; if the offence was interfering with or stopping a promising attack, the player is not cautioned.
> 
> - Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

This does not stop the referee from penalizing a more serious offense that occurs at the same time. If a player SPA in the penalty area which was an attempt for the ball (no card) and commits:
- reckless foul. The referee would still show a yellow card for the reckless foul.
- lack of respect of the game - (e.g. blatant holding). The referee would still show a yellow card for lack of respect of the game.
- persistent offenses. The referee would still show a yellow card for persistent offences.

I cover the scenario of what two do if two offenses occur at the same time at "Advantage" > "Disciplinary Action".

If a goal is scored after the DOGSO offense after playing advantage, then the caution will be shown. I have never seen a professional referee do this - they usually just give no card. (TODO - Video example)
