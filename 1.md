[YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=3151) Weird bobbling of the hands - unprofessional

🟡 [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=3439) #10 Strake Jesuit - INC Front Holding while in possession of the ball

https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=3841 #6 Shadow Creek. Goal! 1-0

🟡 [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=4085) #5 Shadow Creek - INC Holding. Opposing player then pushes hime off. 

🔴 [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=4465) INC. Push off by #9 Shadow Creek should of been called and it was not kicked but shined to the goalkeeper. Also, free kick is 8 yards away from the spot of the incorrectly called goalkeeper backpass.

🟠 Same video as above. INS #00 Shadow Creek (Goalkeeper) is delaying the restart of play (YC) by not letting go of the ball. The opposing team is trying to grab the ball. 

🟠 [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=4554) INC. #8 Strake Jesuit - INC Front Holding. Take Foul / Stopping a Promising Attack.

🔴 [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=4841) INC. #8 Strake Jesuit - Take Foul / Stopping a Promising Attack. Seeing he was beat he stick his hip out to impede the opponent who would of kept possession of the ball and start a counter-attack. This would of been his second yellow card. 

[YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=4953) Shouts for Delaying the restart (YC) but this was correctly handled. I had said in the pre-game I will be strict about this and to give ~5 yards. This was far enough.

[YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=5035) Shadow Creek Goalkeeper #00 goes to ground when not necessary - verbally start the 5 second countdown as soon as that happens to discourage this behavior.

[YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=5050) AR calls push off - I was not in the pocket/position but would of called it as well since defensive third.

Half time. [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=5258)

[YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=5935) #2 Shadow Creek fouls the guy twice. They play throguh and pass then get shot off. But, I don't think I saw this live.

🔵 [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=6064) #7 Shadow Creek CYC - Reckless kick in the chest. There was a similar play earlier in the game just outside the penalty area but I felt like that was impeding rather than a direct kick to the chest. 

[YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=6134) Possible kick. Hard to see.

[YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=6247) Late slide tackle. I deemed it more of a trip than a direct hit so no card but played advantage. Hard to see and I trust the AR has a better view than us.

🟡 [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=6257) INC. #7 Shadow Creek. Missed handball and wrong team given throw-in.

[YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=6491) Possible head to ground contact. The defender jumps on to the arms/body of the opponent and falls awkwardly. I think the no-call is correct.

🟠 [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=6529) IR Goalkick called for Shadow Creek. Should of been corner kick for Strake Jesuit. I was so focused on whether to call playing in a dangerous manner for the bicycle kick near two opponents that I lost focus on everything else. While studs were at neck level, they were not faced at anyone so not calling playing in a dangerous manner is good by me.

[YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=6600) Wall Managment. When the defender sees me not looking he scoots forward. Don't think its YC worthy but keep this in mind.

🟡 [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=6641) IR. Throw-in wrongly awarded for Strake Jesuit. I pointed in the direction opposite the ball was going. Did not realize that it was the attacker kicking it backwards. 

🔵 [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=6655) CYC. #5 Shadow Creek. for delaying the restart. Kick the ball when set for the free kick - the ball was correctly spotted on the 16 yard line. I am pointing to the 17 yard line while the ball is on the 16 yard line so I could see this being managed without a YC but I am fine the the YC.

🔴 [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=6856) INC. #19 Strake Jesuit. The player stomps with studs on the attacker's kicking foot (#22 Shadow Creek - video is bit grainy but confident here) very late and jumped with two feet rather than a kicking or blocking motion. This should of been a direct red card for Serious Foul Play. #19 could of been agrivated a bit because before this Shadow Creek tossed the ball in the air to his teammate to waste time on the throw-in. I was not looking at the challenge and did not see it since it was so unexpected but played signaled advantage since they had the ball ball - seems like no one else saw it as well.

[YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=7050) Goalkeeper to ground unnessairly. Start the 5 sec verbal countdown.

[YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=7179) Goalkeeper to ground unnessairly. Start the 5 sec verbal countdown.

🔵 [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=7220) CC. Push off. It's easy to tell here because defender falls but if defender didn't fall would I have called it.

[YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=7276) Why am I wrapping my hands.

❓ [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=7285) Defender uses opponent's shoulder to propel himself higher for a header in the penalty area. I did not see this live. I'm torn about this - the ball is directly at them but is this worth a free goal. This could of gone either way.

❓ [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=7308) The defender wins the ball. There seems to be no direct hit of either leg. When the attcker tries to land the kicking foot, it lands weirdly because the defender is there. But, it's hard to see.  

[YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=7413) Goal. 1-1. #8 Strake Jesuit. He should of already been sent-off for two yellow card offenses (Read above.)

🟠 [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=7512) IC. The ball was last played by the defender so this could not have been offside. I wasn't sure who had last touched it. I had also seen the offside flag late so I wans't sure where in the sequence offside occured. Since the goalkeeper was away from goal, I am giving this medium impact.

🟠 [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=7646) INC. #3 Strake Jesuit. Unsporting behavior (YC)/ Holding when the opponent has beaten you

[YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=7961) I get in the way. Team keeps the ball so no dropped ball. 

[YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=8023) #3 Strake Jesuit. Goal. Leading 2-1

🔴 [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=8168) IC Goal should of stood. No player was offside. 

🟠 [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=8241) #8 Strake Jesuit. INC. Take foul / Stopping a proming an attack / Holding when beaten. Should of been a YC. This would of been his third yellow card of the game for take fouls.

There was a lot of simulation in the game - more than usual.
- [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=7817) - this guy does the superman
- two to three more examples from earlier
