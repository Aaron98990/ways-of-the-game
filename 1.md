[YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=3151) Weird bobbling of the hands - unprofessional

🟡 [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=3439) #10 Strake Jesuit - INC Front Holding while in possession of the ball

https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=3841 #6 Shadow Creek. Goal! 1-0

🟡 https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=4085 #5 Shadow Creek - INC Holding. Opposing player then pushes hime off. 

🔴 https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=4465 INC. Push off by #9 Shadow Creek should of been called and it was not kicked but shined to the goalkeeper. Also, free kick is 8 yards away from the spot of the incorrectly called goalkeeper backpass.

🟠 Same video as above. INS #00 Shadow Creek (Goalkeeper) is delaying the restart of play (YC) by not letting go of the ball. The opposing team is trying to grab the ball. 

🟠 https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=4554 INC. #8 Strake Jesuit - INC Front Holding. Take Foul / Stopping a Promising Attack.

🔴 https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=4841 INC. #8 Strake Jesuit - Take Foul / Stopping a Promising Attack. Seeing he was beat he stick his hip out to impede the opponent who would of kept possession of the ball and start a counter-attack. This would of been his second yellow card. 

https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=4953 Shouts for Delaying the restart (YC) but this was correctly handled. I had said in the pre-game I will be strict about this and to give ~5 yards. This was far enough.

https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=5035 Goalkeeper goes to ground when not necessary - verbally start the 5 second countdown as soon as that happens to discourage this behavior.

https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=5050 AR calls push off - I was not in the pocket/position but would of called it as well since defensive third.

Half time. https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=5258

https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=5935 #2 Shadow Creek souls the guy twice. They play throguh and pass then get shot off. But, I don't think I saw this live.

🔵 https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=6064 #7 Shadow Creek CYC - Reckless kick in the chest. There was a similar play earlier in the game just outside the penalty area but I felt like that was impeding rather than a direct kick to the chest. 

https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=6134 Possible kick. Hard to see.

https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=6247 Late slide tackle. I deemed it more of a trip than a direct hit so no card but played advantage. Hard to see.

🟡 https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=6257 INC. #7 Shadow Creek. Missed handball and wrong team given throw-in.

https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=6491 Possible head to ground contact. I think the no-call is correct.
