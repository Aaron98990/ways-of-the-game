🟡 [YT](https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=3439) #10 Strake Jesuit - INC Front Holding while in possession of the ball

https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=3841 #6 Shadow Creek. Goal! 1-0

🟡 https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=4085 #5 Shadow Creek - INC Holding. Opposing player then pushes hime off. 

🔴 https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=4465 INC. Push off by #9 Shadow Creek should of been called and it was not kicked but shined to the goalkeeper. Also, free kick is 8 yards away from the spot of the incorrectly called goalkeeper backpass.

🟠 Same video as above. INS #00 Shadow Creek (Goalkeeper) is delaying the restart of play (YC) by not letting go of the ball. The opposing team is trying to grab the ball. 

🟠 https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=4554 #8 INS. Strake Jesuit - INC Front Holding. Take Foul / Stopping a Promising Attack.

🔴 https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=4841 INS. #8 Strake Jesuit - Take Foul / Stopping a Promising Attack. Seeing he was beat he stick his hip out to impede the opponent who would of kept possession of the ball and start a counter-attack. This would of been his second yellow card. 

https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=4953 Shouts for Delaying the restart (YC) but this was correctly handled. I had said in the pre-game I will be strict about this and to give ~5 yards. This was far enough.

https://www.youtube.com/live/clVbb-1GQ5Q?feature=shared&t=5050 AR calls push off - I was not in the pocket but also called it just because it seems so.
