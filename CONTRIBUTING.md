To get an overview of the project, read the [README](/README.md).

More videos.
- Especially sections with "TODO". The video must be hosted on another site (e.g. YouTube)
- For YouTube, please use the start time function and start the video at the correct place. On Web, click "Share" and check "Start at" and input the correct time.
- Ensure to check [the geo restriction site ](https://polsy.org.uk/stuff/ytrestrict.cgi) and at minimum the video must be allowed in the United States. Ideally, there should be no geo restrictions on the video and that requirement may be added if "Ways of the Game" becomes popular with a global audience.

Be concise.
- We are not covering every scenario or a replacement for the Laws.

Terms should align with the current Laws of the Game:
- Do not use penalty spot, use penalty mark.
- Do not use game, use match
- Do not use field or pitch, use field of play.
- Unsporting behavior not ungentlemanly conduct (outdated)
- Do not use persistent infringement (outdated) for persistent offenses
- Do not use linesman for assistant referee
- Do not use center referee for referee. Do not use referees for match officials.

Do not use acronyms or abbreviations other than YC, RC, FIFA, IFAB, SPA, and DOGSO. The pages should be easy to ready for everyone.
- Do not use LotG or LOG, write out Law/Laws or Laws of the Game
- Write out AR as assistant referee
- INDFK (indirect free kick), DFK (direct free kick), DT (dissent), PIADM (playing in a dangerous manner) are not acceptable

It is okay to mix between British English and US English:
- offence vs offense
- penalise vs penalize
- colour vs color
- realize and behavior are others where there may be difference.

Remain gender neutral unless referring to a specific person.

Do not use works like Obviously or Per tradition. Explain it and the reasoning.

Video Review, AAR, and fourth official duties are not covered.

The use of parenthesis should clarify a word or phrase. But, removing the words in parenthesis must not change the meaning of the sentence.
- Example: "It's handball if the attackers hand/arms are bigger (unnaturally or naturally)"
