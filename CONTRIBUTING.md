To get an overview of the project, read the [README](/README.md).

More videos.
- Especially sections with "TODO". The video must be hosted on another site (e.g. YouTube)

Be concise.
- We are not covering every scenario or a replacement for the Laws.

Terms should align with the current Laws of the Game:
- Do not use penalty spot, use penalty mark.
- Unsporting behavior not ungentlemanly conduct (outdated)
- Do not use persistent infringement (outdated) for persistent offenses
- Do not use linesman for assistant referee
- Do not use center referee for referee. Do not use referees for match official.

Do not use acronyms or abbreviations other than YC, RC, FIFA, IFAB, SPA, and DOGSO. The pages should be easy to ready for everyone.
- Do not use LotG or LOG, write out Law/Laws or Laws of the Game
- Write out AR as assistant referee
- INDFK (indirect free kick), DFK (direct free kick), DT (dissent), PIADM (playing in a dangerous manner) are not acceptable

It is okay to mix between British English and US English:
- offence vs offense
- penalise vs penalize
- colour vs color
- realize and behavior are others where there may be difference.

Remain gender neutral unless referring to a specific person.

Video Review, AAR, and fourth offical duties are not covered.
