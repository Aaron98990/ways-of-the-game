> The referee:

> - Law 5.3 Power and duties

The referee has the power to play advantage. This is an extension of Law 9.1 as the ball is not of play until the "play has been stopped by the referee". If the ball has "wholly passed over the goal line or touchline" or "touches a match official, remains on the field of play, and meets one of the conditions" - advantage cannot be played.

"penalizing the offense if the anticipated advantage does not ensue ... within a few seconds." is also a skill. Just because a team maintains possession of the ball (e.g. the ball is played away from goal) or takes a shot at goal (e.g. foul causes player to be off balance) does not necessarily mean that the advantaage ensued.

- [The foul should of been brought back as advantage never materializes - the ball goes away from goal.](https://youtu.be/xqQqe-LwWXc?t=866)

Please note the wording "allows play to continue when an offense occurs". This means advantage can be applied not just to fouls but to any offense in the Laws of the Game.

> The ball is out of play when:
> - it has wholly passed over the goal line or touchline on the ground or in the air
> - play has been stopped by the referee
> - it touches a match official, remains on the field of play and:
>   - a team starts a promising attack or
>   - the ball goes directly into the goal or
>   - the team in possession of the ball changes
>       In all these cases, play is restarted with a dropped ball.
> - Law 9.1 Ball out of play

Advantage cannot be used when the ball is not properly put into play from a restart. For example, if a player incorrectly takes a throw-in (e.g. not standing, not facing the field of play, or ball not thrown with both hands) and the ball goes to an opponent - the referee cannot play advantage.

> The referee may play advantage whenever an offense occurs but should consider the following in deciding whether to apply the advantage or stop play:
> - the severity of the offense – if the offense warrants a sending-off, the referee must stop play and send off the player unless there is a clear opportunity to score a goal
> - the position where the offense was committed – the closer to the opponent’s goal, the more effective the advantage can be
> - the chances of an immediate, promising attack
> - the atmosphere of the match
> - Guidelines for Match Officials

Knowing when to play advantage is a skill. In higher levels of the game, not stopping the flow of the game is important to players so although it looks like advantage did not materialize, the players prefer it. 

## Advantage signal

Law 5.6 shows two approved referee signals for advantage. 

It is one arm or two arms pointing in the attacking direction of team playing the advantage.

## When to play advantage

> Advantage should not be applied in situations involving serious foul play, violent conduct or a second cautionable offense unless there is a clear opportunity to score a goal. The referee must send off the player when the ball is next out of play, but if the player plays the ball or challenges/interferes with an opponent, the referee will stop play, send off the player and restart with an indirect free kick, unless the player committed a more serious offense.
> 
> - Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

It is not recomended to play advantage on offenses against the goalkeeper unless there is a clear opportunity to score a goal. If advantage is played in this case and the goalkeeper is injured, play should be stopped when the goalkeeper's team loses the ball.

## Advantage while holding

Advantage also includes holding. This is clarified to be clear but is already covered. Most offenses occur at a single point (push, charge, jumps at) but holding occurs at many points and continuously while a player is being held.

> If a defender starts holding an attacker outside the penalty area and continues holding inside the penalty area, the referee must award a penalty kick.
> 
> - Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

## Disciplinary action

Just because advantage is played does not mean that a referee cannot caution or send-off the offender - the referee will show the cards when play stops. 
- [A player commits a reckless tackle. The referee signals advantage. When the ball is out of play, the player is cautioned for the reckless tackle.](https://youtu.be/eFxYX4x1za0?t=790)
- [A player commits a reckless tackle. The referee signals advantage. After the goal is scored, the player is cautioned for the reckless tackle.](https://youtu.be/BbcPFAvyIZU)

> If the referee plays the advantage for an offense for which a caution/sending-off would have been issued had play been stopped, this caution/sending-off must be issued when the ball is next out of play. However, if the offense was denying the opposing team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity the player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour; if the offense was interfering with or stopping a promising attack, the player is not cautioned.
> - Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

- [A player commits DOGSO. The referee signals advantage. When the ball is out of play, the offender is shown a yellow card since advantage wwas played.](https://youtu.be/nSQmRSoMvtw?feature=shared&t=267) <!-- MLS Instant Replay covered this - https://youtu.be/uV3xeyjUge8?feature=shared&t=26 -->

There may be instance where a player commits two cautionable offenses in close proximity - but not at the same time - that should result in two cautions.
> Where two separate cautionable offenses are committed (even in close proximity), they should result in two cautions, for example if a player enters the field of play without the required permission and commits a reckless tackle or stops a promising attack with a foul/handball, etc.
> - Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action
- [A player commits unsporting behavior by impeding the throw-in. The referee signals advantage. The player then stops a promising attack. The player is cautioned for both offenses and is sent-off.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpEhnyG_WWc)
- [A player makes a reckless challenge on an opponent. The referee signals advantage. The player then stops a promising attack. The player is cautioned for both offenses and is sent-off.](https://youtu.be/P1jELHaraJs)

A common example of a player committing two offenses at the same time:
- Stopping a Promising Attack outside the penalty area
- Unsporting behavior / Reckless

Although the player committed more than one offense, the sanction (caution) and restart (direct free kick) are the same but reckless behavior is considered to have more "physical severity" and therefore will only be shown one caution for for reckless behavior.

> punishes the more serious offense, in terms of sanction, restart, physical severity and tactical impact, when more than one offense occurs at the same time
> - Law 5.3 Powers and duties

The "(unless as outline below)" enumerates the law above. DOGSO, serious foul play, biting or spitting at someone have the same sanction (send-off) and restart (direct free kick) but serious foul play, biting or spitting at someone, and violent conduct have more "physical severity" than DOGSO and therefore on the referee's match report - the incident will be reported only as the more serious offense.

> A player, substitute or substituted player who commits any of the following offenses is sent off:
> - denying a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity to an opponent whose overall movement is towards the offender’s goal by an offense punishable by a free kick (unless as outlined below)
> - serious foul play
> - biting or spitting at someone
> - violent conduct

- [The goalkeeper commits DOGSO and Serious Foul Play at the same time. The goalkeeper is sent-off only for Serious Foul Play.](https://youtu.be/dmZcFRB-1wo?t=121)

## Rare: Delaying the restart of play to show a card

> Once the referee has decided to caution or send off a player, play must not be restarted until the sanction has been administered, unless the non-offending team takes a quick free kick, has a clear goal-scoring opportunity and the referee has not started the disciplinary sanction procedure. The sanction is administered at the next stoppage; if the offense was denying the opposing team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, the player is cautioned; if the offense interfered with or stopped a promising attack, the player is not cautioned. Law 12.3

This is rarely used. This is not advantage since the ball is out of play but is a similar concept as the referee decides not to stop/ delay play. Soccer games are determined by the number of goals scored not cautions/send-offs - so this is beneficial for the team that's losing. 
- [The referee could have not delayed the restart and allowed the quick free kick under this Law. If the referee does this, since the offense was Stopping a Promising Attack outside penalty area (YC), it would be downgraded to no card. ](https://youtu.be/XBaIqWtWkGA)
