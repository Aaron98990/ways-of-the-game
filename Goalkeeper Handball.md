The goalkeeper commiting a handball offense in their own penalty area and there are no other offenses is always an indirect free kick and no sanction and no disciplinary action is taken. 

A goalkeeper commiting a handball offense outside their own penalty area is just like any other non-goalkeeper player, a direct free kick with the appropiate sanction / disciplinary action (SPA, Persistent Offenses, Lack of Respect for the Game, or DOGSO) is taken.

## Outside the goalkeeper's own penalty area

> The goalkeeper has the same restrictions on handling the ball as any other player outside the penalty area.
> 
> - Law 12.1 Direct free kick

The Law should probably read "outside the goalkeeper's penalty area" but is still correct. Read more in TODO section.

### On the Line

While the goalkeeper is releasing the ball, remember that the boundary lines that makes the penalty area is considered to be part of the penalty area. A goalkeeper commits no offense when they have their body outside their own penalty area but the ball is making contact with their hands in their own penalty area (including above the boundary lines that make the penalty area)

## Inside the goalkeeper's own penalty area

> An indirect free kick is awarded if a goalkeeper, inside their penalty area, commits any of the following offences:
> 
> - controls the ball with the hand/arm for more than six seconds before releasing it
> 
> - touches the ball with the hand/arm after releasing it and before it has touched another player
> 
> - touches the ball with the hand/arm, unless the goalkeeper has clearly kicked or attempted to kick the ball to release it into play, after:
>   
>   - it has been deliberately kicked to the goalkeeper by a team-mate
>   
>   - receiving it directly from a throw-in taken by a team-mate
> 
> - Law 12.2 Indirect free kick

A kick is defined in the Laws of the Game 

> Kick
> 
> The ball is kicked when a player makes contact with it with the foot and/or the ankle
> 
> - Glossary - Football terms

A player that heads, knees, chests, or use the area between the knee and ancle (shin) the ball to their goalkeeper to pick up with their hands without using a trick to circumvent the Laws then no offfense has been commited.

It is accepted to not call the "controls the ball with the hand/arm for more than six seconds before releasing it" unless several warnings are given and until at least 15 seconds of control with the hand/arm - it is meant only for egregious cases.

### Disciplinary Action

Unless the goalkeeper commits a more serious offense at the same time (talked about in the next section), a goalkeeper can not be cautioned or sent off for handling the ball in their own penalty area. This includes if the referee determined that the goalkeeper's offense is Persistent Offenses or Stopped a Promising Attack (SPA) or Denied an Obvious Goal Scoring Opportunity (DOGSO) - this is where the "except a goalkeeper within their penalty area" exception in the disciplinary action section comes from.

> A player, substitute or substituted player who commits any of the following offences is sent off:
> 
> - denying the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by a handball offence (except a goalkeeper within their penalty area)
> 
> - Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

Weirldy enough, they do not add it for Persistent Offeneses or Stopping a Promising Attack by handball although "(except a goalkeeper within their penalty area)" still applies. 

> There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour including if a player:
> 
> - handles the ball to interfere with or stop a promising attack
> 
> - Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

### Two Offenses at Once

> If the goalkeeper handles the ball inside their penalty area when not permitted to do so, an indirect free kick is awarded but there is no disciplinary sanction. However, if the offence is playing the ball a second time (with or without the hand/arm) after a restart before it touches another player, the goalkeeper must be sanctioned if the offence stops a promising attack or denies an opponent or the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity.
> 
> - Law 12.1 Direct free kick

This is a bit confusing to read. Let me summarize. 

If the goalkeeper takes the free kick or goal kick or throw-in (or even a kick-off) then handles the ball inside their own penalty area before the ball has touched another player, they have commited two offeneses at the same time:

- > If, after the ball is in play, the kicker touches the ball again before it has touched another player, an indirect free kick is awarded
  > 
  > - Law 16.2, 13.2 Offenses and Sancctions

- > An indirect free kick is awarded if a goalkeeper, inside their penalty area, commits any of the following offences:
  > 
  > - touches the ball with the hand/arm, unless the goalkeeper has clearly kicked or attempted to kick the ball to release it into play, after:
  >   
  >   - it has been deliberately kicked to the goalkeeper by a team-mate
  >   
  >   - receiving it directly from a throw-in taken by a team-mate
  > 
  > - Law 12.2 Indirect Free Kick

Team-mate in the Laws of the Game includes passing it to oneself. Both offeneses have the same restart, an indirect free kick. But, the double touch allows a player to be cautioned or sent off while the goalkeeper handball in their own penalty area does not - so we punish the more serious offense - the one with a higher sanction (caution/send-off). So, in the eyes of the Law - the goalkeeper only commited the double touch offense. This clarification is really just an extension of another Law written out to be clear.

> The referee:
> 
> - punishes the more serious offence, in terms of sanction, restart, physical severity and tactical impact, when more than one offence occurs at the same time
> 
> - Law 5.3 - Powers and duties

## Circumventing the Law

> - initiates a deliberate trick for the ball to be passed (including from a free kick or goal kick) to the goalkeeper with the head, chest, knee etc. to circumvent the Law, whether or not the goalkeeper touches the ball with the hands; the goalkeeper is penalised if responsible for initiating the deliberate trick
> - Law 12.2 Indirect free kick 

> There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour including if a player:
> 
> - initiates a deliberate trick for the ball to be passed (including from a free kick or goal kick) to the goalkeeper with the head, chest, knee etc. to circumvent the Law, whether or not the goalkeeper touches the ball with the hands; the goalkeeper is cautioned if responsible for initiating the deliberate trick
> - Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

Note that initiating the deliberate trick is the offense, whether or not the goalkeeper picks up the ball or attempts to pick up the ball does not matter.
