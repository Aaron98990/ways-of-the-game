Please note that [reckless (caution)](/reckless), [excessive force (send-off)](/excessive-force) and [tactical impact (SPA and DOGSO)](/tactical-impact) are broken out of the misconduct section because of the importance of the topics. Misconduct, booking, disciplinary action, disciplinary sanction, sanction, caution/send-off, and yellow/red card all generally mean the same thing.

> The yellow card communicates a caution and the red card communicates a sending-off.
> 
> Only a player, substitute, substituted player or team official may be shown the red or yellow card.
> 
> 12.3 Disciplinary action

A referee cannot give a caution or send-off to an outside agent (e.g. spectator, ball kid). In the cases where the referee want an outside agent or sent-off person removed, the referee can suspend the game until that happens. If the outside agent or sent-off person remains, the referee can abandon the match.

> The referee: stops, suspends or abandons the match for any offences or because of outside interference Law 5.3

- [A spectator yells at the assistant referee: "Are you fucking blind or something? WTF is wrong with you". The referee could of suspended the game until the spectator is removed but just abandoned the match.](https://youtu.be/rHqSWjHFyh0?feature=shared&t=648)

> The referee: keeps a record of the match and provides the appropriate authorities with a match report, including information on disciplinary action and any other incidents that occurred before, during or after the match Law 5.3

Footballl associations (FAs) often create codes for misconduct. In the United States, they are called "Report Codes" and their full list is <a href="US%20Misconduct%20Codes.pdf" target=”_blank”>here</a>. In England, they are called "Charge Codes" and their full list is <a href="England%20Misconduct%20Codes.pdf" target=”_blank”>here</a>. The code for dissent (caution) in the United States is "DT" and in England it is "C2".

## Referee's authority
> The referee:
> - has the authority to take disciplinary action from entering the field of play for the pre-match inspection until leaving the field of play after the match ends (including penalties). 
> - has the power to show yellow or red cards and, where competition rules permit, temporarily dismiss a player, from entering the field of play at the start of the match until after the match has ended, including during the half-time interval, extra time and penalties
> 
> Law 5.3 Powers and duties

A referee can show yellow and red cards when they enter the field of play to start the match until they leave the field of play after the match ends including during the coin toss, national anthem, half-time, the referee/player walkout, and after the final whistle and before the referee left the field.

- [The referees sends off and shows a red card after the match.](https://youtu.be/1ThajxMxIOI?t=605)

A referee can caution or send-off someone without showing cards (e.g they forgot or lost them) by communicating that decision to everyone (e.g verbally). This was how misconduct was applied for players until yellow and red cards were used in the 1970 World Cup. 

Temporarily dismissing a player (sin bin) is in the Laws [here](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/guidelines-for-temporary-dismissals/) and would need to be in the competition rules. In England, temporarily dismissing a player is mandatory for dissent across all of grassroots football from the 2019/20 season as shown in <a href="England%20Sin%20Bin.pdf" target=”_blank”>this</a> infographic.

## Playing short

> A player who is sent off:
> - before submission of the team list cannot be named on the team list in any capacity
> - after being named on the team list and before kick-off may be replaced by a named substitute, who cannot be replaced; the number of substitutions the team can make is not reduced
> - after the kick-off cannot be replaced
> 
> A named substitute who is sent off before or after the kick-off may not be replaced.
> 
> Law 3.6 Players and substitutes sent off

During a substitution, until the player leaves the field and the substitute enters the field, they are considered a player.

> The substitution is completed when a substitute enters the field of play; from that moment, the replaced player becomes a substituted player and the substitute becomes a player and can take any restart. Law 3.3

Game(s) suspension other than listed above or fines for a send-off or accumulating cautions is found in the competition rules, not in the Laws of the Game. Usually, it's at least a one game suspension for a sending-off. 

> A player, substitute or substituted player who has been sent off must leave the vicinity of the field of play and the technical area.

Many times competition rules will require the sent-off adult participant to be out-of-sight and out-of-sound and allow sent-off minors to stay in the technical area.

> A match may not start or continue if either team has fewer than seven players. Law 3.1

If a team only has 10 players with no substitutes and two players become injured and can't play and another two are sent-off during the match, then the referee abandons the game unless it's during penalties. The team would only have six players which is lower than the required seven players unless it's penalties.

> A player who has been sent off during the match is not permitted to take part; warnings and cautions issued to players and team officials during the match are not carried forward into penalties (penalty shoot-out).
>
> - With the exception of a substitute for a goalkeeper who is unable to continue, only players who are on the field of play or are temporarily off the field of play (injury, adjusting equipment etc.) at the end of the match are eligible to take kicks
> - If at the end of the match and before or during the kicks one team has a greater number of players than its opponents, it must reduce its numbers to the same number as its opponents and the referee must be informed of the name and number of each player excluded. Any excluded player is not eligible to take part in the kicks (except as outlined below)
> - A goalkeeper who is unable to continue before or during the kicks may be replaced by a player excluded to equalise the number of players or, if their team has not used its maximum permitted number of substitutes, a named substitute, but the replaced goalkeeper takes no further part and may not take a kick
> - If the goalkeeper has already taken a kick, the replacement may not take a kick until the next round of kicks
> 
> Substitutions and sendings-off during penalties (penalty shoot-out):
> - A player other than the goalkeeper who is unable to continue may not be replaced
> - A goalkeeper who is sent off must be replaced by an eligible player
> - The referee must not abandon the match if a team is reduced to fewer than seven players
> 
> Law 10

During penalties unlike other parts of the match:
  - cautions and warnings are reset
  - the game is not abandoned if a team has less than seven players
  - the team with more players must reduce its numbers to the same as its opponents
  - only players at the end of the match may take part except:
    - an injured goalkeeper may be replaced with a named substitue only if substitutions remain or an excluded player

## After play has restarted
> a disciplinary sanction may only be issued after play has restarted if another match official had identified and attempted to communicate the offense to the referee before play restarted; the restart associated with the sanction does not apply.
> Law 5.2

If the assistant referee has their flag up and the referee misses it (e.g for dissent) and play restarted, the sanction can still be given. 

An additional (rare) exception is listed in the [advantage section](/advantage) when a free kick is taken quickly and there is a goal-scoring scoring opportunity and the referee has not stopped the restart/taken the card outs. The [advantage section](/advantage) also discusses committing two cautionable offense at close proximity but not at the same time (often times after an advantage) and committing two cautionable offenses at the same time.

## Mass Confrontations

The referee should not try to break up a mass confrontation. From the outside, watch and write players for sanctions. 
- [PRO Write up](https://proreferees.com/2017/06/28/play-of-the-week-17-mass-confrontation/)

After a mass confrontation or a sent-off person needs to leave and remain out-of-sight and out-of-sound:
- have the players go to their benches
- crew come together
- In mass confrontation, collect/write the sanctions then give it
- [Example of separating players and collecting the ball.](https://youtu.be/2SrxFOGYIto?feature=shared&t=854)
- [Example of secondary confrontation after referee fails to separate teams.](https://youtu.be/w6xm6H6_bFI?feature=shared&t=506)

Mass confrontations rarely happen in women's soccer.

## Warnings

Warnings are an important tool that is not technically misconduct. There are two different types of warnings: private ones (a 1v1 conference) and public ones (where everyone can hear it). They are an important tool to set a message to everyone watching the game on what is acceptable. If you give a warning, you must follow through with misconduct if the offense blatantly happens again (as words mean nothing without action). Match officials should say less than more as the more they say, the more they will be misheard, misunderstood/misinterpreted, or contradict themselves or another match official. Also, particiapnts are more emotional (and exhausted) than logical.

Things to avoid saying publically:
- If you do X, I will do Y. (e.g. If you that again, I'll give you a yellow. Don't tie yourself.)
- This is your only warning. (Don't tie yourself.)
- This is the last play of the game / The game is over when the ball is cleared. (Don't tie yourself. Prefer to say less than a minute.)
- In the pre-game and during the game: Do not tell players how you are going to call the game and what you are going to call and not call. Just do it.

Things to say publically:
- My favorite warning is with gestures only - call the player's number and gesture downwards or figer wag.
- We don't do that here / What are we doing?
- Be smart / Use your head / Don't do something stupid (often times accompanies by pointing to one's head)
- Yo. Yo. Yo. Move on, fam.
- No more (with baseball safe sign)
- Did you ask for permission to sub? (rather than saying I'll card you next time)
- Don't do x. This isn't a suggestion. 

## Cautions

**Before showing a yellow or red card, I recommend to blow the whistle (usually a short-short) right before the card is shown unless immediatly after a foul. This is so no one misses that a card was given.**

This section applies to a player, substitute or substituted player unless otherwise stated.


<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Not dissent**

> - dissent by word or action

Different match officials handle dissent/disagreement differently, but here's a good guideline to follow.

Simply disagreeing with the referee or stating an opinion or fact or having a short and immediate frustration burst at the call/non-call is not in itself dissent:

- "You can overrule the linesman"
- "That's a flop" / "All ball" / "50/50" / "Shoulder to shoulder"
- "That was outside the penalty area."
- "No way that's a foul." / "That's not a foul as well?"
- "What are you calling?" / After explaining, acting like they couldn't hear you so you have to repeat yourself / being passive agressive
- saying something clearly wrong or made up (don't fall for the bait - ignore)
- "Where's the card?" or asking, not demanding for a card (the person wants the game called more tightly)
- "Keep my players safe!" / "Protecy my players" (the person wants the game called more tightly)
- "Control the game." (the person wants the game called more tightly)
- "How can you call that when you're that far away?"
- jumping in frustration or the universal "what?" gesture with hand(s) out, up, or on the head
- the person disagreeing gets the last word in / patronizing attitude
- finger wagging or pointing to locations of missed percieved offenses
- "The other team is getting more fouls than us" / "That's the third time" / "How many more times?" / "All game"
- "I'm going to report you" (say name is on match report)
- "Ask the assistant" (sometimes helpful to ask)
- [Good heckling](/heckles.md)

Players give information on how they want the game called. Take it in sometimes. 

If you respond publically (usually not needed even for statements disguised as questions), wait 1-2 seconds/pause before responding, keep your response extremely brief (1-3 words) or use gestures only. No need to respond again (including with clever comebacks) or be sucked into an argument/lecture. Just walk away and restart play/leave. Do not say "I think" or "I thought" as it conveys uncertainity, say "I have" or "I called" or use no filler. Match officials should say less than more as the more they say, the more they will be misheard, misunderstood/misinterpreted, or contradict themselves or another match official. Also, particiapnts are more emotional and exhausted than logical.

An assistant referee should keep their eyes on the field of play when talking to someone in the technical area. 

You should be walking when talking unless there needs to be an extended conversation (rare). If there needs to be a private extended conversation with someone, stand side to side with them instead of face to face leads to a more confrontational/emotional attitute.

Complaining =/= call is wrong. No Complaining =/= call is correct. Some players and teams are more vocal than others, esspecially when a team expects to win.

In youth games, if the referee allows a team official on the field for an injured player, the referee should move away from the injured player and not be in the path of the team official to avoid unneeded conversation. 

Inexperienced players may take offense to some normal soccer things (contact or common foul or getting a card). Best to manage this without cards. 

Any conversation before, during, or after the match with a non-nuetral person like a coach or spectator should not occur in the referee locker room or within 10 yards the crew put there stuff unless on field of play. This allows one to walk away with a buffer and provides a clear signal the conversation is over. 

After the match or end of half, just leave. "you are terrible" or other short one sentence phrase someone privately says behind you or while passing does not rise to dissent for me. 

Game temperature or the accumulation of small things can lead for these to be considered dissent.

#### **Dissent by word**

> - dissent by word or action

Different match officials handle dissent/disagreement differently, but here's a good guideline to follow.

- Yelling at a match official
  - especially at close distance or at an assistant referee [1](https://youtu.be/1g2DRURrbAo?t=935)
- Continuous, prolonged, or persistent complaining
  - players can't complain about every single call, esspecially trivial or obvious ones
  - players farther away have less leniency to complain, esspecially the goalkeeper
  - failing to move on after an explanation or being warned to
  - complaining publically for more than three sentences (the point has already been made)
  - threatening to lose their cool, if x happens
  - Repeating questions or statements ("Why?" x4, "What did I do?" x4) [1](https://youtu.be/pXahsxNFuZw?feature=shared&t=336)
- Provocative, condescending, or personal comments
  - "What the hell/fuck. That's bullshit/horseshit." / "You are ruining the game"
  - “Referee, are you blind/asleep/dumb/drunk/high?" / "You're a joke." / "Do your job!" / "Do better.”
    - framing as a question or conditional "If you did your job, no one would complain"
  - "Do I need to teach you how to ref? / Is this your first time reffing?" / "Where did you get you license?" / "Go back to ref school."
  - "My grandma could do better." / The AR could ref better.
- Implying bias
  - "Call it both ways." / "Call the game fairly" / "You know that's a foul"
  - "Put a red (opposing team) jersey on" / "It's 12 vs 11" / "We don’t get those type of fouls" / "Hometown ref"
  - “Whose side are you on?” / “You hate us", "You hate Africans”  / "How much did they pay you?"
  - "Whose reffing the game, you or the spectators?"
- For a match offical who has done past games with a team or person, referencing past games is not appropirate while disagreeing with a decision
  - "You do this everytime" / "You are screwing us like you did last time"
- Excessive complaining after changing a decision or "overruling" the assistant referee
  - "You don't know what you're doing?" [1](https://youtu.be/pXahsxNFuZw?feature=shared&t=336)

93% of interpersonal communication is not what is being said. In person-to-person communication:
- Words convey 7% of the message
- Intonation, pitch and pace of speech convey 38%
- Vibes, body movements, gestures, facial expressions convey 55% .

<a href="Bad%20Language%20Mapping.pdf" target=”_blank”>Bad Language Mapping</a>
 
For any remark above: think if it was public or private and how it's delivered. If private and towards you or its delivery is weak, you may just go with a verbal warning or ignore completely, if you deem appropiate. If public and its delivery is condescending/demanding, you can't let your self be undermined as everyone will treat you with less respect so a caution is required.

If the referee decides to give a caution for dissent and wants to stop play, make sure there is no advantage. The restart would be an indirect free kick at the spot of the offense.

#### **Dissent by action**

> - dissent by word or action

Different match officials handle dissent/disagreement differently, but here's a good guideline to follow.

The NBA has a video playlist for "overt gestures" available [here](https://videorulebook.nba.com/rule/overt-gestures/). A technical foul is like a caution. I do not consider a "wave off" dissent.

- gesture the wearing of spectacles
- invading a match official's personal space or blocking their path or unnessairily following a match official
- unnesessairly touching a match official including to get their attention or demonstrate a foul or no foul [1](https://youtu.be/sBfR_l-wrYo?feature=shared&t=969)
- surrounding/crowding a match official (don't bother explaining anything if there are more than two people from the same team) (if needed, show a caution to a player who does not have already have a caution) [1](https://youtu.be/sBfR_l-wrYo?feature=shared&t=1101)
- a player being held back but continues disagreeing
- Air punching towards or away a match official or any other aggressive arm gesture/motion [1](https://youtu.be/hvfV4TPBKxw?feature=shared&t=324), [2](https://youtu.be/ltfnLOybxH8?feature=shared&t=44)
- coming a distance or running to complain, esspecially a goalkeeper [1](https://youtu.be/1g2DRURrbAo?t=805)
- sarcastic or condescending clap/clapping
- throwing (spiking) the ball to the ground [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaRIL13l-hE)
- slamming the ground with the hand(s) 
- kicking/throwing the ball away or holding/blocking it (could also be delay of the restart)
- failing to leave the penalty area and being behind the penalty mark for a penalty kick (could also be delay of the restart)
- complaining with no shirt on or jersey number is not visible (tell them to go away - can't identify the player if it rises to dissent)

If the referee decides to give a caution for dissent and wants to stop play, make sure there is no advantage. The restart would be an indirect free kick at the spot of the offense.

Context matters in all cases: a player slamming the ground since they missed a shot/pass is not dissent. 

#### **Entering/Leaving**

> - entering, re-entering or (for players only - deliberately leaving) the field of play without the referee’s permission

This is the rarest caution. 

A player deliberately leaving the field of play is cautioned only if this was done to cause confusion or gain a tactical advantage. Please note the exceptions for deliberately leaving the field of play. In all the bulleted cases below, permission is not needed to re-enter.
- "A player who crosses a boundary line as part of a playing movement does not commit an offense." Law 3.8 ([This is okay.](https://youtu.be/tuDiylkXHLo))
- "An attacking player may step or stay off the field of play not to be involved in active play [for offside]." Law 11.4
- "Leaving the field of play to celebrate a goal is not a cautionable offense but players should return as soon as possible." Law 12.3
- Retrieving the ball or taking a restart ([This is okay.](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-HZviMbqxc?feature=shared&t=2674))

A non-player entering the field is covered by Law 3.7/3.9 (for non-player, too many players on field). 

A player needing permission to re-enter the field is covered by Law 3.8 (e.g. after an injury or a temporary dismissal (sin-bin) or to fix equipment or leaving the field of play for an extended period of time or after leaving with the referee's permission). 

Injured players must re-enter from the touchline when the ball is in play. This Law requirement seems to be only for injured players but is probably a good practice in general.

>  An injured player may not be treated on the field of play and may only re-enter after play has restarted; if the ball is in play, re-entry must be from the touchline but if the ball is out of play, it may be from any boundary line. _Law 5.2_

For fixing eqiptmeng the Laws says the following:
> A player who leaves the field of play to correct or change equipment must:
>	•	have the equipment checked by a match official before being allowed to re-enter
>	•	only re-enter with the referee’s permission (which may be given during play) _Law 3_

#### **Persistent offenses**

> - (player only) persistent offenses (no specific number or pattern of offenses constitutes ‘persistent’)

This is very subjective and a tool in the referee's toolbox. Here are some valid reasons for persistent offenses:
- A player committing too many fouls or
- A team committing too many fouls, generally after a public warning or
- A team committing too many fouls against one player, generally after a public warning
- second or more player from the same team caught with jewellery during the match

Please note that technically any offense in the Laws of the Game is eligible for this, but this usually applies to just fouls.

PRO Referees has a write up on persistent offenses (formerly called persistent infringements) on this on their website and is available [here](https://proreferees.com/2017/07/12/play-of-the-week-19-persistent-infringement/).

If a referee issues a caution for persistent offenses, they often count with their hands 1,2,3 to signify this or point to different parts of the field where the offenses occurred.

#### **Other offenses**

- unsporting behaviour
  - This is the most common reason to give a caution because it covers a lot of offenses that are listed below.
- delaying the restart of play
  - Covered in the [restarts section](/restarts).
- (player only) failing to respect the required distance when play is restarted with a dropped ball, corner kick, free kick or throw-in
  - Covered in the [restarts section](/restarts).

<!-- tabs:end -->


## Unsporting behaviour

Unsporting behaviour is a caution.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Lack of respect for the game**

> - shows a lack of respect for the game

This is a catch-all. A referee may caution a player for anything. This is very subjective and a tool in the referee's toolbox. Here are some valid reasons for lack of respect for the game:
- showboating or taunting
  - stepping over, staring down, picking up, or standing unnessairly close to an opponent on the ground
  - clapping, signaling the score, pointing, or any gesture at an opponent's face
  - imitating, mocking, or celebrating near an opponent
  - running up to an oppoent including after a percieved foul
  - doing push ups over the ball or sitting on the ball when the ball is in play
  - trash talking (talking about being gay/straight or someone's/a team's appearance, height, skill, or equipment)
- failure to respect a referee's instruction (e.g. asking a player to come to talk to the referee)
- an unsporting goal celebration (covered in the [goals section](/goals))
- non-soccer plays
  - certain holding plays
    - holding a player who is ahead and going to their goal
      - this applies to the entire field of play, including the defensive third
      - the player being held often times stop playing or immediatly is twisted/turns around, making the offense obvious if you don't see it
    - refusing to let go of a player or leg-locking or hooking (locking opponent's arm to body or locking opponent's arm by wrapping/closing the arm)
      - this needs multiple strong whistles to avoid retaliation or mass confrontation
      - an unsuccessful attempt to hook needs a verbal warning
      - a player that is being held (limiting their movement) that tries to push the opponent off should not be cautioned unless they throw the opponent to the ground or do anything else that is unreasonable
    - holding/pulling a player's pants (due to sensitive nature)
    - unnecessarily holding/pulling a player to the ground
    - after multiple instances of front holding which is deceptive as it's hard to see for the match offcial [Example 1](https://youtu.be/06lqnmddvKQ?feature=shared&t=614)
  - interfering with the goalkeeper when they are releasing the ball (impeding, holding, swiping at the ball, attempting to kick)
  - retaliation foul, including for perceived uncalled foul
  - comitting or continuing to foul after the whistle blows or after an obvious foul
- excessive swearing that's not abusive

  [The player blatantly holds their opponent's shirt. There is minimal tactical impact so they receive a caution for lack of respect for the game.](https://youtu.be/DpZ3v-t1dqc?t=718)

#### **Deception/Simulation**

> - attempts to deceive the referee, e.g. by feigning injury or pretending to have been fouled (simulation)

This is known as the flop. A player can be cautioned for this whether or not contact is made with an opponent. 

- [A player runs into a defender's leg in an attempt to deceive the referee and is shown a caution.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_jnrBAPYd4)
- [A player fakes an injury and is cautioned for attempting to deceive the referee.](https://youtu.be/UAbX7wld9vg?t=7646)

Things to look out for:

- intentionally moving their leg towards the opponent to make it appear that they have been tripped
- falling to the ground when there is no or minimal contact
- exsive screaming, yelling, rolling, and other theatrics, even if they have been fouled
- holding a body part (e.g. head or neck) where no or minimal contact is made
- faking an injury (usually to to waste time)

Deceptive handballs esspecially by attackers are another example. They are easy to miss. [Example 1](https://youtube.com/shorts/Fd8KY4Gz6Sg?feature=shared) [Example 2](https://youtube.com/shorts/AFRbJ5K41uQ?feature=shared)

#### **Unauthorized marks**

> - makes unauthorized marks on the field of play

I have only seen a caution for this when players scuffing up the penalty mark or the area near the penalty mark to make the player slip when taking a penalty kick.

[Goalkeeper should of gotten a caution for scuffing up the area near the penalty area.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZN_2D5nlRg)

#### **Verbal distraction**

> - verbally distracts an opponent during play or at a restart

Here are some examples:
- You cannot say "pass it here" or "leave it" to an opponent if you are not the teammate of the person who has the ball.
- You cannot yell/scream for the purpose to scare the opponent when they are attempting to play the ball (e.g. goalkeeper punting the ball)

Clapping is okay as long as its not done in an opponents face.
<!-- - You cannot clap to distract the opponent when they are attempting to play the ball (e.g. penalty kick)  I remember seeing in one of my matches the team-mates clapping as their team-mate takes the penalty kick. That was weird. -->

#### **Permission to leave**

> - plays the ball when leaving the field of play after being given permission to leave

Reference to being given permission to leave the field of play is given in Law 11.4 and Law 3.3 and Law 12.3. It's not entirely clear but if you ask for permission to leave while the ball is in or out of play, you can't play the ball. While you are on the field (and attempting to leave) you will count as a defender for determining offside position. Once you leave the field, you are still a player, but you will not count as a defender for determining offside position. You would need permission to re-enter the field.

If you just left the field without the referee's permission (deliberately or not) you still count as a defender for determining offside position "until the next stoppage in play or until the defending team has played the ball towards the halfway line and it is outside its penalty area" (Law 11.4).

#### **Other offenses**

- changes places with the goalkeeper during play or without the referee’s permission (see Law 3)
  - See the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper). Only applies among players. Does not apply between halves (including extra time) or before penalties.
- commits in a reckless manner a direct free kick offense
  - See the [reckless section](/reckless).
- handles the ball to interfere with or stop a promising attack, except where the referee awards a penalty kick for a non-deliberate handball offence
- denies the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick for a non-deliberate handball offence
- commits any other offense which interferes with or stops a promising attack, except where the referee awards a penalty kick for an offense which was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball
- denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by committing an offense which was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball and the referee awards a penalty kick
  - For the four above, see the [tactical impact section](/tactical-impact)
- handles the ball in an attempt to score a goal (whether or not the attempt is successful) or in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent a goal
  - See the [tactical impact section](/tactical-impact) for "unsuccessful attempt to prevent a goal". 
  - See the [handball section](/handball) for "handles the ball in an attempt to score".
- initiates a deliberate trick for the ball to be passed (including from a free kick or goal kick) to the goalkeeper with the head, chest, knee etc. to circumvent the Law, whether or not the goalkeeper touches the ball with the hands; the goalkeeper is cautioned if responsible for initiating the deliberate trick
  - See the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper).
 
For penalty kicks (Law 14):
- a team-mate of the identified kicker takes the kick; the referee cautions the player who took the kick
- feinting to kick the ball once the kicker has completed the run-up (feinting in the run-up is permitted); the referee cautions the kicker
- If the goalkeeper’s offense results in the kick being retaken (e.g. touching crossbar/nets, not on goal line), the goalkeeper is warned for the first offense in the game and cautioned for any subsequent offense(s) in the game

For unauthorised/dangerous equipment or jewelry (Law 4.1):
- A player who refuses to comply or wears the item again must be cautioned.

<!-- tabs:end -->


## Send-offs

This section applies to a player, substitute or substituted player.

<!-- tabs:start -->
### **Action**

For any remark above: think if it was public or private and how it's delivered. If private and towards you or its delivery is weak, you may just go with dissent (caution), if you deem appropiate. If public and its delivery is condescending/demanding, you can't let your self be undermined as everyone will treat you with less respect so a send-off is required.


### **Second caution**

> - receiving a second caution in the same match

### **Other offenses**

## Team officials

> Where an offense is committed by someone from the technical area (substitute, substituted player, sent-off player or team official) and the offender cannot be identified, the senior team coach present in the technical area will receive the sanction.

>  a red card for a sending-off from the field of play and its immediate surrounds, including the technical area

Competition rules generally will require sent-off team officials to be out-of-sight and out-of-sound. **Other than the senior team coach second caution, all misconduct by people in the technical area (including substitutes) should be dealt with strictly. Even if competition rules allow you to caution or send-off a coach for spectator misconduct, I recommend for you to never do it.**

> A medical team official who commits a sending-off offense may remain if the team has no other medical person available, and act if a player needs medical attention
