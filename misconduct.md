Please note that [reckless (Caution)](/reckless), [excessive force (send-off)](/excessive-force) and [tactical impact (SPA and DOGSO)](/tactical-impact) are broken out of the misconduct section because of the importance of the topics. 

> The yellow card communicates a caution and the red card communicates a sending-off.
> 
> Only a player, substitute, substituted player or team official may be shown the red or yellow card.
> 
> 12.3 Disciplinary action

You may not give a caution or send-off to an outside agent (e.g. spectator, ball kid) or a sent-off player as they have already been sent off.

## Referee's Responsibility

> ### Disciplinary action
> 
> - punishes the more serious offence, in terms of sanction, restart, physical severity and tactical impact, when more than one offence occurs at the same time
> 
> - takes disciplinary action against players guilty of cautionable and sending-off offences
> 
> - has the authority to take disciplinary action from entering the field of play for the pre-match inspection until leaving the field of play after the match ends (including kicks from the penalty mark). If, before entering the field of play at the start of the match, a player commits a sending-off offence, the referee has the authority to prevent the player taking part in the match (see Law 3.6); the referee will report any other misconduct
> 
> - has the power to show yellow or red cards and, where competition rules permit, temporarily dismiss a player, from entering the field of play at the start of the match until after the match has ended, including during the half-time interval, extra time and kicks from the penalty mark
> 
> - takes action against team officials who fail to act in a responsible manner and warns or shows a yellow card for a caution or a red card for a sending-off from the field of play and its immediate surrounds, including the technical area; if the offender cannot be identified, the senior coach present in the technical area will receive the sanction. A medical team official who commits a sending-off offence may remain if the team has no other medical person available, and act if a player needs medical attention
> 
> - acts on the advice of other match officials regarding incidents that the referee has not seen
> 
> Law 5.3 Powers and duties

## Playing short due to a red card

> A player who is sent off:
> 
> - before submission of the team list cannot be named on the team list in any capacity
> 
> - after being named on the team list and before kick-off may be replaced by a named substitute, who cannot be replaced; the number of substitutions the team can make is not reduced
> 
> - after the kick-off cannot be replaced
> 
> A named substitute who is sent off before or after the kick-off may not be replaced.
> 
> 3.6 Players and substitutes sent off



## Penalty kicks

> A player who has been sent off during the match is not permitted to take part; warnings and cautions issued to players and team officials during the match are not carried forward into penalties (penalty shoot-out).
> 
> Law 9 Determining a winner



## Players Cautionable Offenses

> A player, substitute or substituted player is cautioned if guilty of:
> 
> - delaying the restart of play

> 
> - dissent by word or action

TODO Video example
> - entering, re-entering or deliberately leaving the field of play without the referee’s permission

This is the rarest caution. Please note the exceptions to this listed in the Laws.
- "A player who crosses a boundary line as part of a playing movement does not commit an offence." Law 3.8


> - (player only) failing to respect the required distance when play is restarted with a dropped ball, corner kick, free kick or throw-in
>
> 
Covered in the [restarts section](/restarts).
> 
> - (player only) persistent offences (no specific number or pattern of offences constitutes ‘persistent’)
>
> 
This is very subjective and a tool in the referee's toolbox. Here are some valid reasons for persistent offenses:
- A player commiting too many fouls or
- A team commiting too many fouls, generally after a public warning or
- A team commiting to many fouls against one player, generally after a public warning

Please note that any offense in the Laws of the Game is eligible for this. Not just Law 12.1 and Law 12.2 Fouls.

PRO Referees has a write up on persistent offenses (formerly called persistent infrigments) on this on their website and is availabel [here](https://proreferees.com/2017/07/12/play-of-the-week-19-persistent-infringement/).

If a referee issues a caution for persistent offenses, they often count with their hands 1,2,3 to signify this or point to different  parts of the field where the offneses occured.
> 
> - unsporting behaviour
> 
This is the most common reason to give a cuation because it covers a lot of offenses that are listed below.



Players Unsporting

> ### Cautions for unsporting behaviour
> 
> There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour including if a player:
> 
> - attempts to deceive the referee, e.g. by feigning injury or pretending to have been fouled (simulation)
>
This is known as the flop.

> 
> - changes places with the goalkeeper during play or without the referee’s permission (see Law 3)
>
See the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper). Does not apply between halves (including extra time) or before penalties.
> 
> - commits in a reckless manner a direct free kick offence

See the [reckless section](/reckless).
> - handles the ball to interfere with or stop a promising attack

See the [tactical impact section](/tactical-impact)
> - commits any other offence which interferes with or stops a promising attack, except where the referee awards a penalty kick for an offence which was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball

See the [tactical impact section](/tactical-impact)
> - denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by committing an offence which was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball and the referee awards a penalty kick
>
See the [tactical impact section](/tactical-impact)
> 
> - handles the ball in an attempt to score a goal (whether or not the attempt is successful) or in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent a goal
>
See the [tactical impact section](/tactical-impact) for "unsuccessful attempt to prevent a goal". 
See the [handball section](/handball) for "handles the ball in an attemtp to score".
> 
> - makes unauthorised marks on the field of play

I have only seen a caution for this when players scuffing up the penalty spot or the area near the peanlty stop to make the player slip when taking a penalty kick.

[Goalkeeper should of gotten a caution for scuffing up the area near the penalty area.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZN_2D5nlRg)

> - plays the ball when leaving the field of play after being given permission to leave
> 

I have never seen this before.
> - shows a lack of respect for the game

This is a catch-all. A referee may caution a player for anything. Here are some common examples that can (they don;t have to) fall in the category:
- showboating
- blatantly fouling a player (e.g. holding) or commiting handball
> - initiates a deliberate trick for the ball to be passed (including from a free kick or goal kick) to the goalkeeper with the head, chest, knee etc. to circumvent the Law, whether or not the goalkeeper touches the ball with the hands; the goalkeeper is cautioned if responsible for initiating the deliberate trick

See the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper)
> - verbally distracts an opponent during play or at a restart



## Players Sending-off Offenses

> A player, substitute or substituted player who commits any of the following offences is sent off:
> 
> - denying the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by a handball offence (except a goalkeeper within their penalty area)
See the [tactical impact section](/tactical-impact)

> - denying a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity to an opponent whose overall movement is towards the offender’s goal by an offence punishable by a free kick (unless as outlined below)

See the [tactical impact section](/tactical-impact)
> - serious foul play

See the [excessive force section](/excessive-force).
> - biting or spitting at someone
> 
> - violent conduct
>
See the [excessive force section](/excessive-force).
> 
> - using offensive, insulting or abusive language and/or action(s)
> 
> - receiving a second caution in the same match

> 
> A player, substitute or substituted player who has been sent off must leave the vicinity of the field of play and the technical area.

Many times competition rules will require to be out-of-sight and out-of-sound.

## Team Officals

> Where an offence is committed by someone from the technical area (substitute, substituted player, sent-off player or team official) and the offender cannot be identified, the senior team coach present in the technical area will receive the sanction.

I include some of the offenses for which team officals may be warned, cautioned, or sent-off.
