Please note that [reckless (caution)](/reckless), [excessive force (send-off)](/excessive-force) and [tactical impact (SPA and DOGSO)](/tactical-impact) are broken out of the misconduct section because of the importance of the topics. 

> The yellow card communicates a caution and the red card communicates a sending-off.
> 
> Only a player, substitute, substituted player or team official may be shown the red or yellow card.
> 
> 12.3 Disciplinary action

A referee cannot give a caution or send-off to an outside agent (e.g. spectator, ball kid). In the cases where the referee want an outside agent or sent-off person removed, the referee can suspend the game until that happens. If the outside agent or sent-off person remains, the referee can abandon the match.

> The referee: stops, suspends or abandons the match for any offences or because of outside interference Law 5.3

- [A spectator yells at the assistant referee: "Are you fucking blind or something? WTF is wrong with you". The referee could of suspended the game until the spectator is removed but just abandoned the match.](https://youtu.be/rHqSWjHFyh0?feature=shared&t=648)

> The referee: keeps a record of the match and provides the appropriate authorities with a match report, including information on disciplinary action and any other incidents that occurred before, during or after the match Law 5.3

Footballl associations (FAs) often create codes for misconduct. In the United States, they are called "Report Codes" and their full list is <a href="US%20Misconduct%20Codes.pdf" target=”_blank”>here</a>. In England, they are called "Charge Codes" and their full list is <a href="England%20Misconduct%20Codes.pdf" target=”_blank”>here</a>. The code for dissent (caution) in the United States is "DT" and in England it is "C2".

## Referee's authority
> The referee:
> - has the authority to take disciplinary action from entering the field of play for the pre-match inspection until leaving the field of play after the match ends (including penalties). 
> - has the power to show yellow or red cards and, where competition rules permit, temporarily dismiss a player, from entering the field of play at the start of the match until after the match has ended, including during the half-time interval, extra time and penalties
> 
> Law 5.3 Powers and duties

A referee can show yellow and red cards when they enter the field of play to start the match including during the coin toss, national anthem, and referee/player walkout until they leave the field of play after the match ends. 

- [The referees sends off and shows a red card for a player and some team officials after the match.](https://youtu.be/1ThajxMxIOI?t=605)

A referee can caution or send-off someone without showing cards (e.g they forgot or lost them) by communicating that decision to that person (e.g verbally). This was how misconduct was applied for players until yellow and red cards were used in the 1970 World Cup. 

Temporarily dismissing a player (sin bin) is in the Laws [here](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/guidelines-for-temporary-dismissals/) and would need to be in the competition rules. In England, temporarily dismissing a player is mandatory for dissent across all of grassroots football from the 2019/20 season as shown in <a href="England%20Sin%20Bin.pdf" target=”_blank”>this</a> infographic.

## Playing short

> A player who is sent off:
> - before submission of the team list cannot be named on the team list in any capacity
> - after being named on the team list and before kick-off may be replaced by a named substitute, who cannot be replaced; the number of substitutions the team can make is not reduced
> - after the kick-off cannot be replaced
> 
> A named substitute who is sent off before or after the kick-off may not be replaced.
> 
> Law 3.6 Players and substitutes sent off

Game(s) suspension other than listed above or fines for a send-off or accumulating cautions is found in the competition rules, not in the Laws of the Game. Usually, it's at least a one game suspension for a sending-off. 

> A player, substitute or substituted player who has been sent off must leave the vicinity of the field of play and the technical area.

Many times competition rules will require the sent-off adult participant to be out-of-sight and out-of-sound and allow sent-off minors to stay in the technical area.

> A match may not start or continue if either team has fewer than seven players. Law 3.1

If a team only has 10 players with no subs and two players become injured and can't play and another two are sent-off during the match, then the referee abandons the game. The team would only have six players which is lower than the required seven players.

## After play has restarted
> a disciplinary sanction may only be issued after play has restarted if another match official had identified and attempted to communicate the offense to the referee before play restarted; the restart associated with the sanction does not apply.
> Law 5.2

If the assistant referee has their flag up and the referee misses it (e.g for dissent) and play restarted, the sanction can still be given. 

An additional (rare) exception is listed in the [advantage section](/advantage) when a free kick is taken quickly and there is a goal-scoring scoring opportunity and the referee has not stopped the restart/taken the card outs. The [advantage section](/advantage) also discusses committing two cautionable offense at close proximity but not at the same time (often times after an advantage) and committing two cautionable offenses at the same time.

## Mass Confrontations

After a mass confrontation, separate the teams to their benches to avoid any secondary confrontations and so the referee is not surrounded. Grab the ball. Have the entire crew come between the two teams, discuss what happened, who should be cautioned or sent off, and if the game needs to be called tighter. Call the players that will be cautioned or sent-off to the referee crew and show them the appropiate cards.

- [Example of separating players and collecting the ball.](https://youtu.be/2SrxFOGYIto?feature=shared&t=854)
- [Example of secondary confrontation after referee fails to separate teams.](https://youtu.be/w6xm6H6_bFI?feature=shared&t=506)

## Penalties

> A player who has been sent off during the match is not permitted to take part; warnings and cautions issued to players and team officials during the match are not carried forward into penalties (penalty shoot-out).
> 
> Law 9 Determining a winner

## Warnings

Warnings are an important tool that is not technically misconduct. There are two different types of warnings: private ones (a 1v1 conference) and public ones (where everyone can hear it). They are an important tool to set a message to everyone watching the game on what is acceptable. No one should be surprised when you give a caution - esspecially in situations that referees enforce differently. If you give a public warning, you must follow through with misconduct if the offense blatantly happens again (as words mean nothing without action).

Things to avoid saying publically:
- If you do X, I will do Y. (e.g. If you that again, I'll give you a yellow. Don't tie yourself.)
- This is your only warning. (Don't tie yourself.)
- This is the last play of the game. (Don't tie yourself.)

Things to say publically:
- We don't do that here

## Cautions

This section applies to a player, substitute or substituted player unless otherwise stated.


<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Not dissent**

> - dissent by word or action

Different match officials handle dissent/disagreement differently, but here's a good guideline to follow.

Simply disagreeing with the referee or stating an opinion or fact or having a short and immediate frustration burst at the call/non-call is not dissent.

- "You can overrule the linesman"
- "That's a flop"
- "That was outside the penalty area."
- "No way that's a foul."
- "What are you calling?"
- "Where's the card?" or asking, not demanding for a card (the person wants the game called more tightly)
- "Keep my players safe!" (the person wants the game called more tightly)
- "Control the game." (the person wants the game called more tightly)
- "How can you call that when you're that far away?"
- jumping in frustration or the universal "what?" gesture with hand(s) out or hand(s) on the head
- the person disagreeing gets the last word in
- finger wagging or pointing to locations of missed percieved offenses


Players give information on how they want the game called. Take it in sometimes.

#### **Dissent by word**

> - dissent by word or action

Different match officials handle dissent/disagreement differently, but here's a good guideline to follow.

- Yelling at a match official, especially at close distance [The player should of gotten a caution for yelling at the referee "All ball" at close distance.](https://youtu.be/1g2DRURrbAo?t=935)
- Continuous, prolonged, persistent complaining
  - players can't complain about every single call, esspecially trivial ones
  - players farther away have less leniency to complain, esspecially the goalkeeper
  - failing to move on after an explanation or being warned to
- Provocative or Personal Comments
  - “Referee, are you blind? You're a joke. Do your job! Do better.”
  - "Do I need to teach you how to ref? / Is this your first time reffing?"
  - "My grandma could do better." / The AR could ref better.
- Repeating questions or statements
  - Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
  - What did I do? What did I do? What did I do?
  - No. No. No. No.
- Suggesting a team is getting favorable calls without referencing specific calls
  - "Call it both ways." / "You're calling everything for the other team."
  - "Call the game fairly" / "We don’t get those type of fouls"
  - “Whose side are you on?” / "How much did they pay you?"
- For a match offical who has done past games with a team/person, referencing past games is not appropirate while disagreeing with a decision
  - "You do this everytime" / "You are screwing us like you did last time"
- complaining about obvious fouls
  - after an obvious foul, a player can not complain about it. If they do, they 1) really believe what they did notthing wrong (and it needs to be explained to what was wrong without caution) or 2) they are complaining in bad faith or showing willful ignorance (and they should be cautioned as nothing you will say will get to them and to signal to everyone else that this is not okay)

93% of interpersonal communication is not what is being said. In person-to-person communication:
- Words convey 7% of the message
- Intonation, pitch and pace of speech convey 38%
- Vibes, body movements, gestures, facial expressions convey 55% .

<a href="Bad%20Language%20Mapping.pdf" target=”_blank”>Bad Language Mapping</a>
 
For any remark above: think if it was public or private and how it's delivered. If private and towards you or its delivery is weak, you may just go with a verbal warning or ignore completely, if you deem appropiate. If public and its delivery is condescending/demanding, you can't let your self be undermined as everyone will treat you with less respect so a caution is required.

#### **Dissent by action**

> - dissent by word or action

Different match officials handle dissent/disagreement differently, but here's a good guideline to follow.

The NBA has an 11 video playlist for "overt gestures" available [here](https://videorulebook.nba.com/rule/overt-gestures/). A technical foul is like a caution. I do not consider a "wave off" dissent.

- gesture the wearing of spectacles
- invading a match official's personal space
- surrounding a match official (don't bother explaining anything if there are more than two people)
- Air punching towards or away a match official or any other aggressive motion [Example 1](https://youtu.be/hvfV4TPBKxw?feature=shared&t=324), [Example 2](https://youtu.be/ltfnLOybxH8?feature=shared&t=44)
- coming a distance or running to complain [The goalkeeper comes a distance to complain with the referee.](https://youtu.be/1g2DRURrbAo?t=805)
- sarcastic or condescending clap/clapping
- throwing (spiking) the ball to the ground [Example 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaRIL13l-hE)
- slamming the ground with the hand(s) 
- kicking/throwing the ball away or holding/blocking it (could also be delay of the restart)

Context matters in all cases: a player slamming the ground since they missed a shot/pass is not dissent. 

#### **Entering/Leaving**

> - entering, re-entering or (for players only - deliberately leaving) the field of play without the referee’s permission

This is the rarest caution. 

A player deliberately leaving the field of play is cautioned only if this was done to cause confusion or gain a tactical advantage. Please note the exceptions for deliberately leaving the field of play. In all the bulleted cases below, permission is not needed to re-enter.
- "A player who crosses a boundary line as part of a playing movement does not commit an offense." Law 3.8 ([This is okay.](https://youtu.be/tuDiylkXHLo))
- "An attacking player may step or stay off the field of play not to be involved in active play [for offside]." Law 11.4
- "Leaving the field of play to celebrate a goal is not a cautionable offense but players should return as soon as possible." Law 12.3
- Retrieving the ball or taking a restart ([This is okay.](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-HZviMbqxc?feature=shared&t=2674))

A non-player entering the field is covered by Law 3.7/3.9 (for non-player, too many players on field). 

A player re-entering the field is covered by Law 3.8 (only for players who need permission to re-enter after an injury or to fix equipment or leaving the field of play for an extended period of time or after leaving with the referee's permission).

#### **Persistent offenses**

> - (player only) persistent offenses (no specific number or pattern of offenses constitutes ‘persistent’)

This is very subjective and a tool in the referee's toolbox. Here are some valid reasons for persistent offenses:
- A player committing too many fouls or
- A team committing too many fouls, generally after a public warning or
- A team committing too many fouls against one player, generally after a public warning

Please note that technically any offense in the Laws of the Game is eligible for this, but this usually applied to just fouls.

PRO Referees has a write up on persistent offenses (formerly called persistent infringements) on this on their website and is available [here](https://proreferees.com/2017/07/12/play-of-the-week-19-persistent-infringement/).

If a referee issues a caution for persistent offenses, they often count with their hands 1,2,3 to signify this or point to different parts of the field where the offenses occurred.

#### **Other offenses**

- unsporting behaviour
  - This is the most common reason to give a caution because it covers a lot of offenses that are listed below.
- delaying the restart of play
  - Covered in the [restarts section](/restarts).
- (player only) failing to respect the required distance when play is restarted with a dropped ball, corner kick, free kick or throw-in
  - Covered in the [restarts section](/restarts).

<!-- tabs:end -->


## Unsporting behaviour

Unsporting behaviour is a caution.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Simulation**

> - attempts to deceive the referee, e.g. by feigning injury or pretending to have been fouled (simulation)

This is known as the flop. A player can be cautioned for this whether or not contact is made with an opponent. 

- [A player runs into a defender's leg in an attempt to deceive the referee and is shown a caution.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_jnrBAPYd4)
- [A player fakes an injury and is cautioned for attempting to deceive the referee.](https://youtu.be/UAbX7wld9vg?t=7646)

PRO writes about with three video examples [here](https://proreferees.com/2017/07/12/play-of-the-week-19-persistent-infringement/).

Usual acts of simulation or embellishment include:

- exaggerating the effect of a normal contact challenge
- intentionally moving his leg towards his opponent to make it appear that he has been tripped
- falling to the ground when the contact between him and the opponent was not sufficient to cause the fall
- Falling in an overly dramatic manner designed to attract the referee’s attention

#### **Lack of respect for the game**

> - shows a lack of respect for the game

This is a catch-all. A referee may caution a player for anything. This is very subjective and a tool in the referee's toolbox. Here are some valid reasons for lack of respect for the game:
- showboating or taunting
  - stepping over or staring down an opponent
  - clapping or signaling the score in an opponent's face
  - imitating, mocking, or celebrating near an opponent
  - doing push ups over the ball or sitting on the ball
  - trash talking (talking about being gay/straight or someone's appearance, skill, or equipment)
- failure to respect a referee's instruction (e.g. asking a player to come to talk to the referee)
- an unsporting goal celebration (covered in the [goals section](/goals))
- blatantly commiting an offfense
  - holding a player's jersey from the front while moving or tugging jersey with two hands
    - front holding is deceptive as it's hard to see for the match offcial [Example 1](https://youtu.be/06lqnmddvKQ?feature=shared&t=614)
  - blatantly committing handball unless the ball was going out
  - attempting to kick the ball the ball when the goalkeeper is releasing it
- excessive swearing that's not abusive

  [The player blatantly holds their opponent's shirt. There is minimal tactical impact so they receive a caution for lack of respect for the game.](https://youtu.be/DpZ3v-t1dqc?t=718)

#### **Unauthorized marks**

> - makes unauthorized marks on the field of play

I have only seen a caution for this when players scuffing up the penalty spot or the area near the penalty spot to make the player slip when taking a penalty kick.

[Goalkeeper should of gotten a caution for scuffing up the area near the penalty area.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZN_2D5nlRg)

#### **Verbal distraction**

> - verbally distracts an opponent during play or at a restart

Here are some examples:
- You cannot say "pass it here" to an opponent if you are not the teammate of the person who has the ball.
- You cannot yell/scream for the purpose to scare the opponent when they are attempting to play the ball (e.g. goalkeeper punting the ball)
<!-- - You cannot clap to distract the opponent when they are attempting to play the ball (e.g. penalty kick)  I remember seeing in one of my matches the team-mates clapping as their team-mate takes the penalty kick. That was weird. -->

#### **Permission to leave**

> - plays the ball when leaving the field of play after being given permission to leave

Reference to being given permission to leave the field of play is given in Law 11.4 and Law 3.3 and Law 12.3. It's not entirely clear but if you ask for permission to leave while the ball is in or out of play, you can't play the ball. While you are on the field (and attempting to leave) you will count as a defender for determining offside position. Once you leave the field, you are still a player, but you will not count as a defender for determining offside position. You would need permission to re-enter the field.

If you just left the field without the referee's permission (deliberately or not) you still count as a defender for determining offside position "until the next stoppage in play or until the defending team has played the ball towards the halfway line and it is outside its penalty area" (Law 11.4).

#### **Other offenses**

- changes places with the goalkeeper during play or without the referee’s permission (see Law 3)
  - See the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper). Only applies among players. Does not apply between halves (including extra time) or before penalties.
- commits in a reckless manner a direct free kick offense
  - See the [reckless section](/reckless).
- handles the ball to interfere with or stop a promising attack, except where the referee awards a penalty kick for a non-deliberate handball offence
- denies the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick for a non-deliberate handball offence
- commits any other offense which interferes with or stops a promising attack, except where the referee awards a penalty kick for an offense which was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball
- denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by committing an offense which was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball and the referee awards a penalty kick
  - For the four above, see the [tactical impact section](/tactical-impact)
- handles the ball in an attempt to score a goal (whether or not the attempt is successful) or in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent a goal
  - See the [tactical impact section](/tactical-impact) for "unsuccessful attempt to prevent a goal". 
  - See the [handball section](/handball) for "handles the ball in an attempt to score".
- initiates a deliberate trick for the ball to be passed (including from a free kick or goal kick) to the goalkeeper with the head, chest, knee etc. to circumvent the Law, whether or not the goalkeeper touches the ball with the hands; the goalkeeper is cautioned if responsible for initiating the deliberate trick
  - See the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper).
 
For penalty kicks (Law 14):
- a team-mate of the identified kicker takes the kick; the referee cautions the player who took the kick
- feinting to kick the ball once the kicker has completed the run-up (feinting in the run-up is permitted); the referee cautions the kicker
- If the goalkeeper’s offense results in the kick being retaken (e.g. touching crossbar/nets, not on goal line), the goalkeeper is warned for the first offense in the game and cautioned for any subsequent offense(s) in the game

For unauthorised/dangerous equipment or jewelry (Law 4.1):
- A player who refuses to comply or wears the item again must be cautioned.

## Send-offs

This section applies to a player, substitute or substituted player.

<!-- tabs:start -->
### **Action**

https://youtu.be/CsXRRa6KUSQ?t=21

> - using offensive, insulting or abusive language and/or action(s)

- aggressive and avoidable contact with an offical while dissenting
  - [Abusive action.](https://youtu.be/CsXRRa6KUSQ?t=21)
- intefering with the match offical from showing a card or writing or taking a match offical's equipment
  - [Interfering with showing the card.](https://youtu.be/tv9SZ3ptOUk?feature=shared&t=135)
- mobbing a match official - if three or more players are dissenting at the same time and at close distance to a match offical (mobbing) - send one of them off 
  - [Writeup ](/mobbing)
- an abusive gesture made without touching another person (e.g. middle finger, banging a fist into an open palm, waving fists, deliberately revealing genitals)
- Grabbing an opponent's jersey and pulling them to your face is an abusive action. 
  - [Abusive action.](https://youtu.be/2ybxt6CusMc?feature=shared&t=1130)
- Standing on top of a player on the ground
  - [Abusive action](https://youtu.be/CP5o_bPAYrg?feature=shared&t=1411)
- includes sexual physical actions towards another person that doesn't involve excessive force. This includes deliberately pulling an opponent's pants down, non-consensual slapping an opponent's butt, or non-consensual kissing an opponent


### **Language**

> - using offensive, insulting or abusive language and/or action(s)

- Threatening/wishing violence or injury to another person
  - "I'll fuck you up"
- An insult based on race, gender, sexual orientaion, national origin, religion or sex (discrimination)
- Insulting the referee or any another person
  - "You are *" / "Are you *?" - "You are terrible/incopetent/the worst/twat/idiot/stupid/cheater/corrupt."
  - "* you" - "Fuck you"


93% of interpersonal communication is not what is being said. Scientific analysis has determined that in person-to-person communication:
- Words convey 7% of the message
- Intonation, pitch and pace of speech convey 38%
- Vibes, body movements, gestures, facial expressions convey 55% .

<a href="Bad%20Language%20Mapping.pdf" target=”_blank”>Bad Language Mapping</a>
 
For any remark above: think if it was public or private and how it's delivered. If private and towards you or its delivery is weak, you may just go with dissent (caution), if you deem appropiate. If public and its delivery is condescending/demanding, you can't let your self be undermined as everyone will treat you with less respect so a send-off is required.


### **Second caution**

> - receiving a second caution in the same match

Do yourself a favor and don't make excuses for a player. If you would have carded them if they have no yellow cards, card them if they already have a yellow card.

### **Other offenses**

- denying the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by committing a deliberate handball offence (except a goalkeeper within their penalty area)
- denying the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by committing a non-deliberate handball offence outside their own penalty area
- denying a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity to an opponent whose overall movement is towards the offender’s goal by an offense punishable by a free kick (unless as outlined below)
  - For the three above, see the [tactical impact section](/tactical-impact)
- serious foul play
- biting or spitting at someone
- violent conduct
  - For the three above, see the [excessive force section](/excessive-force)

<!-- tabs:end -->

## Team officials

> Where an offense is committed by someone from the technical area (substitute, substituted player, sent-off player or team official) and the offender cannot be identified, the senior team coach present in the technical area will receive the sanction.

>  a red card for a sending-off from the field of play and its immediate surrounds, including the technical area

Many times, competition rules will require them to be out-of-sight and out-of-sound. **Other than the senior team coach, all team people from the technical area are on a short leash and any offense or misconduct should be dealt with strictly.**

> A medical team official who commits a sending-off offense may remain if the team has no other medical person available, and act if a player needs medical attention

Here are common offenses for which team officials are warned, cautioned, or sent-off for.

> Warning:
> - [...]
> - entering the field of play in a respectful/non-confrontational manner
> 
> Caution:
> - [...]
> - delaying the restart of play by their team
> - dissent by word or action
> 
> Sent off:
> - [...]
> - delaying the restart of play by the opposing team e.g. holding onto the ball, kicking the ball away, obstructing the movement of a player
> - deliberately leaving the technical area to:
>   - show dissent towards, or remonstrate with, a match official
> - entering the field of play to:
>   - confront a match official (including at half-time and full-time)
>   - interfere with play, an opposing player or a match official
> - entering the opposing technical area in an aggressive or confrontational manner
