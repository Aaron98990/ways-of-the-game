Please note that [reckless (Caution)](/reckless), [excessive force (send-off)](/excessive-force) and [tactical impact (SPA and DOGSO)](/tactical-impact) are broken out of the misconduct section because of the importance of the topics. 

> The yellow card communicates a caution and the red card communicates a sending-off.
> 
> Only a player, substitute, substituted player or team official may be shown the red or yellow card.
> 
> 12.3 Disciplinary action

You may not give a caution or send-off to an outside agent (e.g. spectator, ball kid) or a sent-off player as they have already been sent off.

## Referee's Responsibility

> ### Disciplinary action
> 
> - punishes the more serious offence, in terms of sanction, restart, physical severity and tactical impact, when more than one offence occurs at the same time
> 
> - takes disciplinary action against players guilty of cautionable and sending-off offences
> 
> - has the authority to take disciplinary action from entering the field of play for the pre-match inspection until leaving the field of play after the match ends (including kicks from the penalty mark). If, before entering the field of play at the start of the match, a player commits a sending-off offence, the referee has the authority to prevent the player taking part in the match (see Law 3.6); the referee will report any other misconduct
> 
> - has the power to show yellow or red cards and, where competition rules permit, temporarily dismiss a player, from entering the field of play at the start of the match until after the match has ended, including during the half-time interval, extra time and kicks from the penalty mark
> 
> - takes action against team officials who fail to act in a responsible manner and warns or shows a yellow card for a caution or a red card for a sending-off from the field of play and its immediate surrounds, including the technical area; if the offender cannot be identified, the senior coach present in the technical area will receive the sanction. A medical team official who commits a sending-off offence may remain if the team has no other medical person available, and act if a player needs medical attention
> 
> - acts on the advice of other match officials regarding incidents that the referee has not seen
> 
> Law 5.3 Powers and duties
