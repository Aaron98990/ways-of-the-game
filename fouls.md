Fouls are physical (as opposed to verbal) offenses, generally listed in Law 12, commited against a single opponent including when no contact is made. Handball and "makes contact with the ball with a held object" are not considered a foul since it is not against any one oppponent and are covered in the [handball section](/handball). Also, offside is not a foul since it is not an offense against any one oppoent and is covered in the [offside section](/offside).

Soccer is a physichal sport. Not every contact with the opponent is a foul. 

Fouls that occur before or after a player wins the ball should be penalized.

> Direct and indirect free kicks and penalty kicks can only be awarded for offences committed when the ball is in play. If the ball is out of play, play is restarted according to the previous decision.

## Tackles

[No foul. The player cleanly tackles the ball. Their opponent then runs into the player. No foul has been commited. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKa17voHa2k)

[Foul. No card. Not all tackles are yellow cards. I have this as a careless tackle. Althoguh the ball was no longer in playing distance when contact was made by the offender, the contact made by the offender is minimal/glancing and the attempt to play the ball was genuine. ](https://youtu.be/1g2DRURrbAo?t=700)

[No foul. The defender comes in with the bottom of his cleats exposed which contain studs. His cleats land on the top of the ball and clears the ball out of the field of play. Going in to a challenge like this is risky and if mis-timed would be an easy yellow or red card.](https://youtu.be/1g2DRURrbAo?t=735)

## Jumps At

[Foul. No Card. No contact to the head. Both players are genuinly going for the ball.](https://youtu.be/Q3Vg9y1j8vY?t=510)

[Foul. No Card. While one player is not even looking at the ball, the amount of force was minimal. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjuiEPfchz0)

## Charge

A player cannot be charged (even fairly) by an oponent when not in playing distance of the ball.

> If the ball is within playing distance, the player may be fairly charged by an opponent.
> 
> Law 12.2 Indirect Free Kick

> Playing distance
> 
> Distance to the ball which allows a player to touch the ball by extending the foot/leg or jumping or, for goalkeepers, jumping with arms extended. Distance depends on the physical size of the player
> 
> Glossary

The goalkeeper cannot be challenged (including being charged) by an oponent when in control of the ball with the hand(s).

> A goalkeeper cannot be challenged by an opponent when in control of the ball with the hand(s).

> Law 12.2 Indirect free kick


[No Foul. The ball is within playing distance and the charge was not careless, reckless, or using execessive force.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiPsNRm5xV8)


## Impeding the progress of an opponent

> Impeding the progress of an opponent means moving into the opponentâ€™s path to obstruct, block, slow down or force a change of direction when the ball is not within playing distance of either player.
>
> All players have a right to their position on the field of play; being in the way of an opponent is not the same as moving into the way of an opponent.
>
> A player may shield the ball by taking a position between an opponent and the ball if the ball is within playing distance and the opponent is not held off with the arms or body. If the ball is within playing distance, the player may be fairly charged by an opponent.

Impeding the progress of an opponent, often called obstruction, is a direct free kick if contact was made. It is an indirect free kick if no contact was made.

[A player runs into the path of the opponent and impedes the progress of an opponent although the player takes the brunt of the force and profusely starts to bleed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06lqnmddvKQ&t=712s)

## Playing in a dangerous manner

> Playing in a dangerous manner is any action that, while trying to play the ball, threatens injury to someone (including the player themself) and includes preventing a nearby opponent from playing the ball for fear of injury.
> 
> A scissors or bicycle kick is permissible provided that it is not dangerous to an opponent.

If the offense involves contact with an opponent, it is not playing in a danerous manner. A direct free kick should always be given.

It is not an offense to play the ball on the ground as goalkeepers do that a lot. It is only an offense if the player makes it impossible for opponents to play the ball without kicking the player.

A high boot near an opponent face is a common offense here. A player can kick the ball from above the head as long as it does not threaten to injure someone.

## Fouls against the goalkeeper
These are indirect free kicks.
- preventing/blocking a goalkeeper from releasing the ball from their hands
- trying to kick/play the ball when the goalkeeper is holding it

  This is covered in the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper)
