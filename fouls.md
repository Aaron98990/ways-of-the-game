Fouls are physical offenses, generally listed in Law 12, committed against a single opponent including when no contact is made. Handball, "makes contact with the ball with a held object", and offside are not considered a foul since it is not against any one opponent.

Soccer is a physical sport. Not every contact with the opponent is a foul. [No foul.](https://youtu.be/xqQqe-LwWXc?feature=shared&t=20m47s)

Fouls that occur before (going through an opponent) or after (the follow through) a player wins/touches/shoots the ball should be penalized. This includes when they are off balance or in their kicking motion.
- Unfair follow through. [Example 1](https://youtu.be/FBvnXY29jHs?feature=shared&t=85), [Example 2](https://youtu.be/xNAVqoAXnvg?feature=shared&t=243), [Example 3](https://youtu.be/ybVefZeKoxE?feature=shared&t=314)
- Unfirly going through the opponent. [Example 1](https://youtu.be/KE_T1KNniTA?feature=shared&t=2m44s), [Example 2](https://youtu.be/o4wWxBZ_vs0?feature=shared&t=252)

One player may win the ball fairly, but another team-mate may still commit a foul. [Foul.](https://youtu.be/1ThajxMxIOI?feature=shared&t=10)

Just because a foul or offense happens, does not mean that the referee stops play. Read more in the [advantage section](/advantage).

> ‘What needs to be seen’ is not always in the vicinity of the ball. The referee should also pay attention to:
> - player confrontations off the ball
> - possible offences in the area towards which play is moving
> - offences occurring after the ball is played away

> Direct and indirect free kicks and penalty kicks can only be awarded for offenses committed when the ball is in play. If the ball is out of play, play is restarted according to the previous decision.

> If an offence involves contact [with an opponent], it is penalised by a direct free kick.

## Common fouls

If someone starts hopping they probably have been kicked. You can hear when another person is kicked. [No foul.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKa17voHa2k, [Foul.](https://youtu.be/1g2DRURrbAo?t=700)

Jumping is okay. Jumping (generally not straight up) at another player is not. [Foul.](https://youtu.be/Q3Vg9y1j8vY?t=510), [Foul.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjuiEPfchz0)

Push off before headers are fouls. [Foul.](https://youtu.be/IP-4dxu721E?feature=shared&t=127)

Small push that puts a player ahead of the ball is a foul. [Foul](https://youtu.be/bAgwBqYVUhM?feature=shared&t=24)

## Charge

> Charge (an opponent): Physical challenge against an opponent, usually using the shoulder and upper arm (which is kept close to the body)
>
> Glossary

A player cannot be charged (even what is normally considered fair) by an opponent when not in playing distance of the ball. **After a player shoots or passes the ball, the opponent cannot charge them as the ball is not in playing distance.**

> If the ball is within playing distance, the player may be fairly charged by an opponent.
> 
> Law 12.2 Indirect Free Kick

> Playing distance: Distance to the ball which allows a player to touch the ball by extending the foot/leg or jumping or, for goalkeepers, jumping with arms extended. Distance depends on the physical size of the player Glossary

The goalkeeper cannot be challenged (including being charged) by an opponent when in control of the ball with the hand(s).

> A goalkeeper cannot be challenged by an opponent when in control of the ball with the hand(s).
> 
> Law 12.2 Indirect free kick

- [No Foul. The ball is within playing distance and the charge was fair.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiPsNRm5xV8)

The player who charges into another player may remain standing or appear to have commit a fair charge because of momentum. The player who takes the charge will absorb all the impact.

The Laws do mention anything about "shoulder to shoulder". Two player running a straight path to the ball who are even and whose shoulders make contact is fair.

## Impeding the progress of an opponent

Trips and "impeding the progress of an opponent with contact" are unique in that the player that initiates the contact does not commit a foul. 

An attempt to trip (esspecially when a player avoids or stops to not be tripped) is also a direct free kick foul even if there is no contact.

- [Foul. Although the player does not fall, the defender sticks his leg out and slows down the attacker.](https://youtu.be/ySYtHDT99aE?feature=shared&t=401)
- [Foul. Although the attacker trips from the legs behind the defender, he still impedes his path.](https://youtu.be/FxcrgGIW_pw?feature=shared&t=962)

> Impeding the progress of an opponent means moving into the opponent’s path to obstruct, block, slow down or force a change of direction when the ball is not within playing distance of either player.
>
> All players have a right to their position on the field of play; being in the way of an opponent is not the same as moving into the way of an opponent.
>
> A player may shield the ball by taking a position between an opponent and the ball if the ball is within playing distance and the opponent is not held off with the arms or body. If the ball is within playing distance, the player may be fairly charged by an opponent.

Impeding the progress of an opponent, often called obstruction, is a direct free kick if the offense involves contact with an opponent or else its an indirect free kick.

- Impeding with contact. [Direct free kick.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06lqnmddvKQ&t=712s), [Direct free kick.](https://youtu.be/79cBWbiWElA?feature=shared&t=657)
- Fair shields but shielder gets fouled. [Example 1](https://youtu.be/sHZh_FoLeIY?feature=shared&t=238), [Example 2](https://youtu.be/06lqnmddvKQ?feature=shared&t=961)
- When a ball is passed, sometimes a player moves in a position to block the opponent from getting the ball. [Subjective.](https://youtu.be/Ffqx5ZmthOg?feature=shared&t=5592)

## Playing in a dangerous manner

> Playing in a dangerous manner is any action that, while trying to play the ball, threatens injury to someone (including the player themself) and includes preventing a nearby opponent from playing the ball for fear of injury.
> 
> A scissors or bicycle kick is permissible provided that it is not dangerous to an opponent.

The restart is an indirect free kick. If the offense involves contact with an opponent it is not playing in a dangerous manner and a direct free kick should be given.

- a player on the ground trapping the ball, making it impossible for nearby opponents to play the ball. It is not an offense to play the ball while on the ground (like slide tackles or goalkeeper saves). [1](https://www.tiktok.com/@refsneedlovetoo/video/7210174612053757227)
- studs to an opponent's head or outstrached leg. It is not an offense to kick the ball that is above the head.
- sitting on the ball, trapping the ball between the body (e.g. legs, head and shoulder) when an opponent is also challenging for the ball.
- heading the ball while on the ground when an opponent is also challenging for the ball.
- a player uses the shoulders of a teammate to jump higher to head the ball <!-- (This was explicitally in 1990-91 Laws of the Game - "(4) If a player leans on the shoulders of another player of his own team in order to head the ball, the referee shall stop the game, caution the player for ungentlemanly conduct and award an indirect free-kick to the opposing side .") -->


**Don't make it complicated: If anyone thinks its playing in a dangerous manner and they are not just saying it because the ball was played on the ground, just call it.**

## Kicking/throwing an object
> play is restarted with a direct free kick from the position where the object struck or would have struck the person or the ball or interfered with play:
> - If a player [...] throws or kicks an object (including a ball) at [another person] or the match ball or
> - If a [non-player on the team lists] or player temporarily off the field of play throws or kicks an object onto the field of play and it interferes with play, an opponent or match official
> 
> Law 12.4 (I re-worded a lot so not an exact quote)

- [A player kicks an extra ball on the field at the game ball while the ball is in play. The restart is a direct free kick from where the balls made contact and a caution for SPA or lack of respect for the game.](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/13o1pw4/comert_kicks_another_ball_at_vin%C3%ADcius_to_stop_an/)


## Offense outside the field of play
> If, when the ball is in play:
> - a player commits an offense [against anyone except a team-mate or outside agent] outside the field of play or
> - a [non-player on the team lists] commits an offense against, or interferes with, an opposing player or a match official outside the field of play,
> play is restarted with a free kick on the boundary line nearest to where the offense/interference occurred;
> Law 12.4

- [A penalty kick is awarded for an direct free kick offense outside the field of play. Since the nearest boundary line is the penalty area, a penalty kick is awarded.](https://youtu.be/kW7fo3kRo14?feature=shared&t=8)

<!-- ## Offense against an outside agent or team-mate
> If the referee stops play for an offence committed by a player [...] against an outside agent, play is restarted with a dropped ball Law 12.4

>  a player commits a physical offence inside the field of play against: a team-mate - a direct free kick or penalty kick -->

## Extra person on the field
> If a [non-player on the team lists] enters the field of play, the referee must:
> - only stop play if there is interference with play
>   
> If play is stopped and the interference was by:
> - a team official, substitute, substituted or sent-off player, play restarts with a direct free kick or penalty kick
> Law 3.7

This is an offense - not a foul. Please note the exception if the ball enters the goal in the [goals section](/goals). If the ball is near the touch line, you may see a coach/sub accidentally enter the field and touch the ball. The restart would be a direct free kick at the position of the touch. In the Spirit of the Game section, I recommended not to punish anyone under this Law if the ball is clearly going out.

- [Direct free kick at the interference spot. A team official enters the field of play and interferes with play. They would be sent-off. Since its a charity match the match official follows 'spirit of the game'.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyjdjm2tbDE)

## Other guidnace
The thirds - a soccer field can be divided into the defensive third, middle third, and offensive third. Fouls in the defensive third are the easiest to get while fouls in the offenive third are harder to get due to their advantagous restart.

Use different whistle lengths and volume. A softer whistle for a minor foul and a longer and louder whistle for a harder foul. Use stong body language and voice to show confidence and help control the match. The tone of your voice are more important than the words you say: your tone should never be meandering, soft, or sound like a suggestion or you'll be ignored everytime; it should be strong, conscise, explicit, and authoratative. 

I recommend to never signal or announe "no foul" until it's clear that your lead assistant referee agrees its no foul. It looks bad to change after announcing no foul.

Watch out for the triple bounce. This occurs when an attacker kicks or plays the ball forward, then the defender is able to kick/play the ball back, then the ball bounces back from the attacker forward. If the referee is not looking closely enough, it may look like the defender never got the ball and look like a foul but unless the defender did a deliberate secondary motion this is never foul. [TODO add video]

A lot of emphasis is put in the referee being in the right position to make a call rather than whether a call or is correct or not. Being in the pocket or having the best angle to see the most things possible (pushing, holding, handball) is important. Vicinity, while less important than angle, helps sells the desision. 
Being directly in front of or behind a players means you miss pulling, pushing ([Example](https://youtu.be/MKLLhW9krmM?feature=shared&t=353)), charging from the front/back and telling if a slide tackle is fair. Being directly to the side means you are guessing on tripping; handball on the player's far side and charging, holding or pulling between two players who are side to side. 

> The best position is one from which the referee can make the correct decision.
>
> Guidelines for Match Officials

Even if you get complaints, always side on calling more fouls (including the soft ones) and slowing the game down (being strict on free kick and throw-in position and ball rolling, asking player to come over to warn them, strictly following the substitution procedure with no substitute entering until the player they are replacing left the field of play and substitutes must enter at the midway line, tieing your shoes, not playing advantage unless clear promising attack, checking ball pressure) if you are new or unfamiliar with the teams, competition, or level of play. Calling a game loose from the start, which is common mistake for new referees in adult games, does not give you credibility and is a recipe for disaster. Loosen or tighten up the game as the game goes.

There are three types of decisions: Instinctual/default/immediate, processed/delayed, and emotional/makeup/following the crowd:
- For instinctual/default/immediate, slow down a second a two to allow for advantage or when giving a card as it may come off unnessairly aggressive.
- There are multiple times that I don't reach for the whistle or card immediatly but after realizing I'm wrong I feel like it's too late to make the call or it looks influenced. Don't be afraid to make processed/delayed calls even if the optics aren't great. Get the call correct. Examples include:
  - After some seconds of thinking I put the pieces together
  - changing a restart or sanction
  - asking someone where a player were hit (like a goalkeeper on the head) or showing an injury
  - someone (e.g. player/coach/spectator) spells it out for me and I agree
  - talking with another match official
- Emotional/makeup/following the crowd call examples are giving the losing team the benefit of the doubt, calling something you don't see based on nearby player reactions, trying to balance foul count, making up for a call that you or some participants believed is incorrect, making a call to get revenge for dissent

> The [assistant referee] must raise the flag when a foul or misconduct is committed in the immediate vicinity or out of the referee’s vision. In all other situations, the AR must wait and offer an opinion if it is required and then inform the referee of what was seen and heard, and which players were involved.
>
> Before signalling for an offence, the [assistant referee] must determine that:
> - the offence was out of the referee’s view or the referee’s view was obstructed
> - the referee would not have applied the advantage
>
> Guidelines for Match Officials

When the assistant referee is signalling, please continue to pay attention to the players and don't get too focused on looking at the referee or you may miss something. [Example](https://youtu.be/hs4880t5I7Y?feature=shared&t=11)
