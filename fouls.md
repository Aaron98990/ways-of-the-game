## Tackles

### No Foul

[The player cleanly tackles the ball. Their opponent then runs into the player. No foul has been commited. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKa17voHa2k)

## Foul

[Foul. No card. Not all tackles are yellow cards. I have this as a careless tackle. Althoguh the ball was no longer in playing distance when contact was made by the offender, the contact made by the offender is minimal/glancing and the attempt to play the ball was genuine. ](https://youtu.be/1g2DRURrbAo?t=700)

[No foul. The defender comes in with the bottom of his cleats exposed which contain studs. His cleats land on the top of the ball and clears the ball out of the field of play. Going in to a challenge like this is risky and if mis-timed would be an easy yellow or red card.](https://youtu.be/1g2DRURrbAo?t=735)

## Jumps At

[Foul. No Card. No contact to the head. Both players are genuinly going for the ball.](https://youtu.be/Q3Vg9y1j8vY?t=510)

[Foul. No Card. While one player is not even looking at the ball, the amount of force was minimal. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjuiEPfchz0)

### Foul

## Impeding the progress of an opponent

> Impeding the progress of an opponent means moving into the opponentâ€™s path to obstruct, block, slow down or force a change of direction when the ball is not within playing distance of either player.
>
> All players have a right to their position on the field of play; being in the way of an opponent is not the same as moving into the way of an opponent.
