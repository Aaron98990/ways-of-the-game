Fouls are physical (as opposed to verbal) offenses, generally listed in Law 12, committed against a single opponent including when no contact is made. Handball and "makes contact with the ball with a held object" are not considered a foul since it is not against any one opponent and are covered in the [handball section](/handball). Also, offside is not a foul since it is not an offense against any one opponent and is covered in the [offside section](/offside).

Soccer is a physical sport. Not every contact with the opponent is a foul. 
- [No foul. Although there is contact the head, the attacker runs into the defender's path/arm who is clearing the ball.](https://youtu.be/xqQqe-LwWXc?feature=shared&t=20m47s)

Fouls that occur before or after a player wins/touches the ball should be penalized.
- [Foul & YC for reckless play. Player gets the ball then slide tackles their opponent.](https://youtu.be/FBvnXY29jHs?feature=shared&t=85)
- [Foul & proper sanction. Player gets the ball then rolls over the top of the ball into the opponents leg.](https://youtu.be/xNAVqoAXnvg?feature=shared&t=243)
- [Foul. Defender kicks the attacker then kicks the ball (goes through the opponent).](https://youtu.be/KE_T1KNniTA?feature=shared&t=2m44s)
- [Foul. Defender goes through the opponent to head the ball.](https://youtu.be/o4wWxBZ_vs0?feature=shared&t=252)

If the attacking player over-runs or attempts but fails to kick the ball, that does not excuse a foul by a defender. The location of the ball does not excuse a foul.
- [Foul. The attacker over-runs the ball and is then unfairly tackled.](https://youtu.be/79cBWbiWElA?feature=shared&t=324)
- [Foul. The attacker over-runs the ball and is fouled.](https://youtu.be/06lqnmddvKQ?feature=shared&t=885)

Just because a foul or offense happens, does not mean that the referee stops play. Read more in the [advantage section](/advantage).

> ‘What needs to be seen’ is not always in the vicinity of the ball. The referee should also pay attention to:
> - player confrontations off the ball
> - possible offences in the area towards which play is moving
> - offences occurring after the ball is played away

- [Foul and YC for lack of respect for the game. While away from the ball, the opponent impedes an opponent with contact in the area towards which play is moving.](https://youtu.be/_UtaB3Pwl_s?feature=shared&t=214)

> Direct and indirect free kicks and penalty kicks can only be awarded for offenses committed when the ball is in play. If the ball is out of play, play is restarted according to the previous decision.
>
> If an offence involves contact [with a person excluding an outside agent], it is penalised by a direct free kick.

## Tackles

- [No foul. The player cleanly tackles the ball. Their opponent then runs into the player. No foul has been committed. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKa17voHa2k)
- [Foul. No card. Not all tackles are yellow cards. I have this as a careless tackle. Although the ball was no longer in playing distance when contact was made by the offender, the contact made by the offender is minimal/glancing and the attempt to play the ball was genuine. ](https://youtu.be/1g2DRURrbAo?t=700)
- [No foul. The defender comes in with the bottom of his cleats exposed which contain studs. His cleats land on the top of the ball and clears the ball out of the field of play. Going in to a challenge like this is risky and if mis-timed would be an easy yellow or red card.](https://youtu.be/1g2DRURrbAo?t=735)



## Jumps At

- [Foul. No Card. No contact to the head. Both players are genuinely going for the ball.](https://youtu.be/Q3Vg9y1j8vY?t=510)
- [Foul. No Card. While one player is not even looking at the ball, the amount of force was minimal. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjuiEPfchz0)

## Charge

A player cannot be charged (even what is normally considered fair) by an opponent when not in playing distance of the ball.

> If the ball is within playing distance, the player may be fairly charged by an opponent.
> 
> Law 12.2 Indirect Free Kick

> Playing distance: Distance to the ball which allows a player to touch the ball by extending the foot/leg or jumping or, for goalkeepers, jumping with arms extended. Distance depends on the physical size of the player Glossary

The goalkeeper cannot be challenged (including being charged) by an opponent when in control of the ball with the hand(s).

> A goalkeeper cannot be challenged by an opponent when in control of the ball with the hand(s).
> 
> Law 12.2 Indirect free kick


- [No Foul. The ball is within playing distance and the charge was not careless, reckless, or using excessive force.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiPsNRm5xV8)

## Trips

Trips and "impeding the progress of an opponent with contact" are unique in that the player that initiates the contact does not commit a foul. An attempt to trip (esspecially when a player avoids or stops to not be tripped) is also a direct free kick foul even if there is no contact.

- [Foul. Although the player does not fall, the defender sticks his leg out and slows down the attacker.](https://youtu.be/ySYtHDT99aE?feature=shared&t=401)
- [Foul. Although the attacker trips from the legs behind the defender, he still impedes his path.](https://youtu.be/FxcrgGIW_pw?feature=shared&t=962)

## Impeding the progress of an opponent

> Impeding the progress of an opponent means moving into the opponent’s path to obstruct, block, slow down or force a change of direction when the ball is not within playing distance of either player.
>
> All players have a right to their position on the field of play; being in the way of an opponent is not the same as moving into the way of an opponent.
>
> A player may shield the ball by taking a position between an opponent and the ball if the ball is within playing distance and the opponent is not held off with the arms or body. If the ball is within playing distance, the player may be fairly charged by an opponent.

Impeding the progress of an opponent, often called obstruction, is a direct free kick if the offense involves contact with an opponent or else its an indirect free kick.

- [Direct free kick. A player runs into the path of the opponent and impedes the progress of an opponent although the player takes the brunt of the force and profusely starts to bleed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06lqnmddvKQ&t=712s)
- [Direct free kick. The defender is facing away from the ball and is not within playing distance.](https://youtu.be/79cBWbiWElA?feature=shared&t=657)
- [A player fairly moves into the opponent's path to shield the ball that is within playing distance and the opponent kicks him. The only foul is for the kick.](https://youtu.be/sHZh_FoLeIY?feature=shared&t=238)
  

## Playing in a dangerous manner

> Playing in a dangerous manner is any action that, while trying to play the ball, threatens injury to someone (including the player themself) and includes preventing a nearby opponent from playing the ball for fear of injury.
> 
> A scissors or bicycle kick is permissible provided that it is not dangerous to an opponent.

The restart is an indirect free kick. If the offense involves contact with an opponent it is not playing in a dangerous manner and a direct free kick should be given.

It is not an offense to play the ball on the ground - goalkeepers do that a lot. It is only an offense if the player makes it impossible for opponents to play the ball without injuring themselves or an opponent (e.g. kicking the player).
- [Indirect free kick. Heading the ball on the ground that should be kicked when an opponent is nearby threatens injury to someone.](https://www.tiktok.com/@refsneedlovetoo/video/7210174612053757227)

A high boot near an opponent face is a common offense. A player can kick the ball from above the head as long as it does not threaten to injure someone.

Holding the ball between the thighs and jumping like a kangaroo when an opponent is nearby threatens injury to the holder. 

If a player leans on the shoulders of another player of their own team in order to head the ball, they threaten injury to themselves. <!-- (This was explicitally in 1990-91 Laws of the Game - "(4) If a player leans on the shoulders of another player of his own team in order to head the ball, the referee shall stop the game, caution the player for ungentlemanly conduct and award an indirect free-kick to the opposing side .") -->

## Fouls against/by the goalkeeper
These are indirect free kicks if the offense involves no contact with the goalkeeper:
- preventing/blocking a goalkeeper from releasing the ball from their hands
- trying to kick/play the ball when the goalkeeper is holding it

A goalkeeper cannot push an opponent with the ball while in control with the hand/arms else it's a penalty kick for the goalkeeper's opponents.

<!-- 1) If the goalkeeper either intentionally strikes
an opponent by throwing the ball vigorously at him
or pushes him with the ball while holding it, the
referee shall award a penalty-kick, if the offence
took place within the penalty-area . Laws of the Game 1990/91 -->

This is covered in the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper)

## Kicking/throwing an object
> play is restarted with a direct free kick from the position where the object struck or would have struck the person or the ball or interfered with play:
> - If a player [...] throws or kicks an object (including a ball) at [another person] or the match ball or
> - If a [non-player on the team lists] or player temporarily off the field of play throws or kicks an object onto the field of play and it interferes with play, an opponent or match official
> 
> Law 12.4 (I re-worded a lot so not an exact quote)

- [A player kicks an extra ball on the field at the game ball while the ball is in play. The restart is a direct free kick from where the balls made contact and a caution for SPA or lack of respect for the game.](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/13o1pw4/comert_kicks_another_ball_at_vin%C3%ADcius_to_stop_an/)

## Other Offenses
> An indirect free kick is awarded if a player: is guilty of dissent, using offensive, insulting or abusive language and/or action(s) or other verbal offences OR commits any other offence, not mentioned in the Laws, for which play is stopped to caution or send off a player

Simulation / Attempting to deceive the referee would be an indirect free kick if the offense involves no contact with another person.


## Offense outside the field of play
> If, when the ball is in play:
> - a player commits an offense [against anyone except a team-mate or outside agent] outside the field of play or
> - a [non-player on the team lists] commits an offense against, or interferes with, an opposing player or a match official outside the field of play,
> play is restarted with a free kick on the boundary line nearest to where the offense/interference occurred;
> Law 12.4

- [A penalty kick is awarded for an direct free kick offense outside the field of play. Since the nearest boundary line is the penalty area, a penalty kick is awarded.](https://youtu.be/kW7fo3kRo14?feature=shared&t=8)
<!-- Associated article to video is here: https://proreferees.com/2017/09/27/play-of-the-week-29/ -->


<!-- ## Offense against an outside agent or team-mate
> If the referee stops play for an offence committed by a player [...] against an outside agent, play is restarted with a dropped ball Law 12.4

>  a player commits a physical offence inside the field of play against: a team-mate - a direct free kick or penalty kick -->

## Extra person on the field
> If a [non-player on the team lists] enters the field of play, the referee must:
> - only stop play if there is interference with play
>   
> If play is stopped and the interference was by:
> - a team official, substitute, substituted or sent-off player, play restarts with a direct free kick or penalty kick
> Law 3.7

This is an offense - not a foul. Please note the exception if the ball enters the goal in the [goals section](/goals). If the ball is near the touch line, you may see a coach/sub accidentally enter the field and touch the ball. The restart would be a direct free kick at the position of the touch. In the Spirit of the Game section, I recommended not to punish anyone under this Law if the ball is clearly going out.

- [Direct free kick at the interference spot. A team official enters the field of play and interferes with play. They would be sent-off. Since its a charity match the match official follows 'spirit of the game'.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyjdjm2tbDE)

## Assistant referees
> The [assistant referee] must raise the flag when a foul or misconduct is committed in the immediate vicinity or out of the referee’s vision. In all other situations, the AR must wait and offer an opinion if it is required and then inform the referee of what was seen and heard, and which players were involved.
>
> Before signalling for an offence, the [assistant referee] must determine that:
> - the offence was out of the referee’s view or the referee’s view was obstructed
> - the referee would not have applied the advantage
