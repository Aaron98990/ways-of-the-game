The Laws of the Game designates three levels of physical severity - Careless, Reckless, and Excessive force. This wording is important - especially in match reports. A player is never sent-off for a reckless challenge and a player is never cautioned for a careless challenge.

> Careless is when a player shows a lack of attention or consideration when making a challenge or acts without precaution. No disciplinary sanction is needed
> 
> Reckless is when a player acts with disregard to the danger to, or consequences for, an opponent and must be cautioned
> 
> Using excessive force is when a player exceeds the necessary use of force and/or endangers the safety of an opponent and must be sent off
> 
> Law 12.1 Direct Free Kicks

The level of physical foul does not depend on intention. A player can unintentionally and not deliberately use excessive force or recklessly commit a foul but that does not change the outcome of the referee's sanction.

There are increased risk factors that a player takes that make a player pull out of a challenge due to momentum. Whenever a player does these, they are taking a risk:
- Running at a high rate of speed
- Lunging or slide tackle
- Making an Ariel Challenge

Soccer has a reputation of being soft but the fact is that referees do not sanction players enough by a lot. Many of the video clips that are shown, do not show the correct sanction.

The Referee Channel on YouTube has a list of 80+ reckless challenges: check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4OiywE4asSdqTZIY2Lpw9ks2BY5ExiR9).

## Reckless Strike

A strike to the neck or head will always be a caution or send-off unless negligible force is used. The challenging part of seeing strikes to the neck or head is that referees are often looking down at the ball or a player's feet so they miss what goes on at the top.

Often time players move their arms out to know where there opponents are or to create space from their opponent or to shield the ball from an opponent. Even if accidental and even if the opponent's head is lower than usually (e.g. short player, when getting up from the ground), players take the risk of having there arms out like that. 

PRO Referees have an excellent write-up on the subject with video examples from the MLS: [Challenging with Hands/Arms](https://proreferees.com/2020/04/20/pro-insight-tool-or-weapon-challenging-with-hands-arms/)

## Reckless Tackle

A tackle where the boot make direct contact with the opponent's ankle or foot is generally a caution. A tackle that is made while the ball is not in playing distance (aka no chance to touch the ball) is generally also a caution. Not all tackles are automatic cautions.

- [A player commits a late reckless tackle that causes a third player to fall down from the impact. The referee signals advantage. When the ball is out of play, the player is cautioned for the reckless tackle.](https://youtu.be/eFxYX4x1za0?t=790)

## Reckless Charge

An American football style charge into an opponent will always be a caution or send-off. I call it the bulldozing into an opponent. 

- [The recklessly charges into an opponent with significant force after the ball is no longer in playing distance. The player should be shown a caution for a reckless charge.](https://youtu.be/Zxnn7GNixcQ?t=678)

- [The player charges the opponent when there is no chance to win the ball. The player should be shown a caution for a reckless charge.](https://youtu.be/vR3DpyYTH2k)
- TODO Video: A player charging the opponent while not challenging for the ball (even a charge that would be considered fair or careless if the ball was in playing distance) could be a yellow because how blatantly stupid it is.

## Recklessly Jumping At

When a player jumps directly up, the risk to the any other player is zeo. But, player when jumping also cover distance while jumping takes a risk at putting the jumper and the other players at risk. 

- [ The white players jumps at and charges an opponent with significant force on the back and was not attempting to play the ball. The player should be shown a caution for a reckless play.](https://youtu.be/u-y3AiAm2pI?t=606)
- [Although the player jumps and wins the ball their momentum causes them to fall into an opponent's back. The player should be shown a caution for reckless play.](https://youtu.be/GYWeklAEl_0?t=6)
- [The player makes no attempt win the ball as they never look for the ball when jumping at the opponent. In addition, the player makes contact with the opponent's head. The player should be shown caution for the recklessly jumping at.](https://youtu.be/CjSmyUcN_XY)
- [A player jumps at the goalkeeper when they have no chance to win the ball. Thee player should be shown a caution for recklessly jumping at.](https://youtu.be/7S_jphEXARY)

## Reckless Kick

Kicks to the face or a kick where a players significantly cocks their foot back or would have had significant follow-through will always be a caution or send-off.

Attempting to kick the ball when the goalkeeper clearly has control with the hand qualifies as reckless.
- TODO: video.

## Reckless Trip

A defender that comes in at a high rate of speed to make a trip should be cautioned. 

Also, when an opponent is jumping for a ball in the air you can't position yourself where they will land or not attempt to header the ball (including ducking down or standing still). This is called undercutting. 

Often, this ducking down action is done by other players but is not intentional. When someone is jumping toward you, the natural reaction is to duck and protect your head. But even when there is no intent, it is still a very dangerous move.

## Reckless Push

If the push causes a third person to fall down from the impact, a caution should generally be given to offender.

[The player pushes their opponent. The momentum of the push causes the opponent to run unto a third player causing them to gall. The player should be shown a caution for the reckless push.](https://youtu.be/qUwa-YNH-ek)
