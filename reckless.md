The Laws of the Game designates three levels of physical severity for misconduct - careless, reckless, and excessive force. This wording is important - especially in match reports.

> Careless is when a player shows a lack of attention or consideration when making a challenge or acts without precaution. No disciplinary sanction is needed
> 
> Reckless is when a player acts with disregard to the danger to, or consequences for, an opponent and must be cautioned
> 
> Using excessive force is when a player exceeds the necessary use of force and/or endangers the safety of an opponent and must be sent off
> 
> Law 12.1 Direct Free Kicks

Whenever a player does these, they are taking an increased risk as its harder to pull out of a challenge and if contact is made with another player, it's more likely to injure them:
- running
- slide tackling
- jumping

The level of physical severity does not depend on:
- intention (deliberate or accidental)
- the score (blowout or close)
- play not being stopped for advantage (including if the non-offending team scores)
- a penalty kick is given
- the number of fouls commited before (including if it's a player, team, or the match's first foul)
- the game type (including friendly or tournament, boys/girls/co-ed, young or old, small-sided or not, recreational or competitive)
- a player's body (including short/tall, thin/fat - thin/short players don't get leeway to be dirty)
- time in the match (including the first or last minute)
- the temperature of the match (just because it's not heated, does not mean it's ignored)
- sportsmanship (including helping opponent up, checking on them, shaking their hand, fist bump, apologizing)

Do not make excuses. Referees do not sanction players enough for physcal severity. These are the type of fouls that cause injuries.

## Strikes at

A strike to the neck or head will always be a caution or send-off unless negligible force is used. The challenging part of seeing strikes to the neck or head is that referees are often looking down at the ball or a player's feet so they miss what goes on at the top.

Often time players move their arms out to know where there opponents are or to create space from their opponent or to shield the ball from an opponent. Even if accidental and even if the opponent's head is lower than usually (e.g. short player, when getting up from the ground), players take the risk of having there arms out like that. PRO Referees have an excellent write-up on the subject with video examples from the MLS: [Challenging with Hands/Arms](https://proreferees.com/2020/04/20/pro-insight-tool-or-weapon-challenging-with-hands-arms/)

**In my experience: The farther away you are from the strike, the more likely you are to see it. If a random person stops playing and starts holding their head, they most likely have been striken and just give the foul but give no cards.**

## Tackle / kicks

Stepping or cataching on an opponent's foot without sliding, jumping, or lunging is generally a caution.
- [Example 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppq4hrSv2Tc&t=154s) / [Example 2](https://youtu.be/w-pwxB-ygjM?feature=shared&t=144)

Any slide tackle that directly catches an opponent is at least a caution (including after winning the ball). Slide tackles which occur between the opponent and the ball and don't directly catch the opponent are less serious.
- [Example 1](https://youtu.be/GBHiiU8lekE?t=386) / [Example 2](https://youtu.be/FxcrgGIW_pw?feature=shared&t=285)

A tackle that is made while the ball is not in playing distance (aka no chance to touch the ball or a late tackle) is generally also a caution. 
- [Example 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJP50N3Jq-E) / [Example 2](https://youtu.be/eFxYX4x1za0?t=790)

Slide tackles from the back of the player, from the front when face to face with an oponent, or in which they are chasing the ball (starting a slide tackle from the opposite direction the ball is travelling) are dangerous. Even when the player wins the ball their trail leg is likely to directly catch their opponent.

Make sure to watch the kicker lands their feet esspecially when kicking or tackling with a large follow through. The kicker is responsible for landing safely.
- [Example 1.](https://youtu.be/cC2xKHflYkY?feature=shared&t=786) / [Example 2.](https://youtu.be/cC2xKHflYkY?feature=shared&t=785)

Another important point to think about is where and when the slide tackle took place. A slide tackle, usually a last ditch maneauvaur, in the defensive or middle third or when the ball is not being played towards the goal (e.g. laterally, near corner flag) or in a blowout game is not needed and has limited benefit. Use your judgement and game managment skills.

Kick above the knee or kicking someone's leg from behind when they're running

## Jumps at / charge / push / trip

An American football style charge into an opponent will always be a caution or send-off, esspecially when its made when the ball is no longer in playing distance. I call it the bulldozing into an opponent. 

- [Example 1](https://youtu.be/Zxnn7GNixcQ?t=678) / [Example 2](https://youtu.be/GBHiiU8lekE?t=420) / [Example 3](https://youtu.be/7cZpV_ZAfzw) / [Example 4](https://youtu.be/vR3DpyYTH2k)

A shoulder charge to an opponent's head or neck that is not part of a face-to-face challenge.
- [Example 1](https://youtu.be/GBHiiU8lekE?t=217)

A charge into a person's back while the ball is relatively still is generally a yellow card.
- [Example 1](https://youtu.be/yueTdu0S_Js?feature=shared&t=120) / [Example 2](https://youtu.be/79cBWbiWElA?feature=shared&t=605)

If a challenge causes a third person to fall down from the impact or someone to hit the goalpost, a caution should generally be given to offender.
- [Example 1](https://youtu.be/qUwa-YNH-ek)

When a player jumps directly up and laterally, the risk to the any other player is zeo. But a player when jumping that cover distance while jumping takes a risk at putting the jumper and the other players at risk. 

- [Example 1](https://youtu.be/u-y3AiAm2pI?t=606) / [Example 2](https://youtu.be/GYWeklAEl_0?t=6) / - [Example 3](https://youtu.be/7S_jphEXARY) / [Example 4 - although there is head contact the force is minimal as far as jumps go](https://youtu.be/CjSmyUcN_XY)

A defender that comes in at a high rate of speed to trip someone should be cautioned. 

When an opponent is jumping for a ball in the air, a player can't position yourself where they will land or not attempt to header the ball (including ducking down or standing still). This is called undercutting or a down under. Often, this ducking down action is done by other players but is not intentional. When someone is jumping toward you, the natural reaction is to duck and protect your head. But even when there is no intent, it is still a very dangerous move.
