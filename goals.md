## Anchored Goals

> Goals (including portable goals) must be firmly secured to the ground.
> 
> - Law 1.10 - Goals

## Goal Nets

> Nets may be attached to the goals and the ground behind the goal; they must be properly supported and must not interfere with the goalkeeper.
> 
> - Law 1.10 - Goals

Goal nets, especially in lower levels of the game, will have holes in them. Just because a ball is in the goal within the nets does noes mean that a goal has been scored. So, please aware of both situations:

- The ball enters the goal but leaves through the a hole in the net
- The ball enters the goal through a hole on the side of the net.

While the assistant referee has the best view of the ball passing the goal line, the referee has the best view that the ball goes between the goalposts and under the crossbar.

## Crossbar and goalpost

> If the crossbar becomes displaced or broken, play is stopped until it has been repaired or replaced in position. Play is restarted with a dropped ball. If it cannot be repaired the match must be abandoned. A rope or any flexible or dangerous material may not replace the crossbar. Law 1.10

Many shots will hit the crossbar or goalpost and remain in play.

> The ball is in play [,,,] when [the ball] rebounds off a goalpost, crossbar or corner flagpost and remains on the field of play.
> 
> Law 9.2 Ball in play

## Goal scored

> A goal is scored when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, between the goalposts and under the crossbar, provided that no offence has been committed by the team scoring the goal.
> 
> - Law 10.1 - Goal scored

Please note that seeing green grass under the ball does not mean a goal has been scored. 

The team the goal is awarded to is determined by the coin toss before the match.

> - the referee tosses a coin and the team that wins the toss decides which goal to attack in the first half or to take the kick-off
> 
> - depending on the above, their opponents take the kick-off or decide which goal to attack in the first half
> 
> - the team that decided which goal to attack in the first half takes the kick-off to start the second half
> 
> - for the second half, the teams change ends and attack the opposite goals
> 
> - Law 8.1 Kick-off

## Advantage

If the defense commits an offence (e.g. handball) then the ball enters the goal, the goal still counts if the referee head not stopped play.

[No goal. The ball touches a match offical then goes into the goal](https://youtu.be/MhWyCGQ9HDU)

## Goal After Interference

> If, after a goal is scored, the referee realises, before play restarts, that an extra person was on the field of play when the goal was scored, and that person interfered with play:
> 
> the referee must disallow the goal if the extra person was:
> 
> - a player, substitute, substituted player, sent-off player or team official of the team that scored the goal; play is restarted with a direct free kick from the position of the extra person
> 
> - an outside agent who interfered with play unless a goal results as outlined above in ‘Extra persons on the field of play’; play is restarted with a dropped ball
>   Law 3.9 Goal scored with an extra perso on the field of play

If the ball goes into the goal but deflected off someone that enters the field of play to block the goal, the goal should generally stand.

> If a ball is going into the goal and the interference does not prevent a defending player playing the ball, the goal is awarded if the ball enters the goal (even if contact was made with the ball) unless the interference was by the attacking team.
> 
> Law 3.7 Extra persons on the field of play

## No footwear or shinguards

> 
> Law 4.2 Compulsory equipment

## Goal Signal

Law 5.6 - Referee signals does not offer a signal for a goal or a kickoff. The unofficial but common signal is to point to the center circle where the kickoff will restart play. The Guidelines for Match Officials recommends a whistle to stop play for a a goal that is not clear.

> The whistle is NOT needed to:
> 
> - stop play for a clear:
>   
>   - goal kick, corner kick, throw-in or goal
> 
> - Guidelines for Match Officals

Law 6.6 - Assistant referee signals does not offer a signal for a goal or kickoff but the Guidelines for Match Officals offers guidance.

> [Assistant referees] indicate when:
> 
> - the whole of the ball leaves the field of play
> - Law 6.1 - Assistant referees

> **Goal/no goal**
> 
> When a goal has been scored and there is no doubt about the decision, the referee and assistant referee must make eye contact and the assistant referee must then move quickly 25–30 metres along the touchline towards the halfway line without raising the flag.
> 
> When a goal has been scored but the ball appears still to be in play, the assistant referee must first raise the flag to attract the referee’s attention then continue with the normal goal procedure of running quickly 25–30 metres along the touchline towards the halfway line.
> 
> On occasions when the whole of the ball does not cross the goal line and play continues as normal because a goal has not been scored, the referee must make eye contact with the assistant referee and if necessary give a discreet hand signal.
> 
> - Guidelines for Match Officals 

[The assistant referee should of raised their flag then run along the touchline rather than the referee stopping play to ask the assistant referee if the ball entered the goal. ](https://youtu.be/DK66w4_vBiI?t=701) 

## Fighting for the Ball After a Goal

 It is commonly accepted that referees do not add enough additional time, so the losing team or the team that just tied the game will try to retrieve the ball to restart play quickly while the other team will stall. No player is entitled to the ball after a goal and players must act responsibility. 

[The referee should of been present to stop the players from fighting for the ball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl6zluuAiwI&t=717s)

## Celebration of a goal

> 
> - climbing onto a perimeter fence and/or approaching the spectators in a manner which causes safety and/or security issues
> 
> - acting in a provocative, derisory or inflammatory way
> 
> - covering the head or face with a mask or other similar item
> 
> - removing the shirt or covering the head with the shirt
> 
> - Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action
