## About the goal

> Goals (including portable goals) must be firmly secured to the ground.
> - Law 1.10 Goals

> Nets may be attached to the goals and the ground behind the goal; they must be properly supported and must not interfere with the goalkeeper. Law 1.10

> If the crossbar becomes displaced or broken, play is stopped until it has been repaired or replaced in position. Play is restarted with a dropped ball. If it cannot be repaired the match must be abandoned. A rope or any flexible or dangerous material may not replace the crossbar. Law 1.10

- [Example 1 - No goal/dropped ball](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTF2U74Jy/)

> The ball is in play [..] when it rebounds off a goalpost, crossbar or corner flagpost and remains on the field of play.
> - Law 9.2 Ball in play

## Goal scored

> A goal is scored when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, between the goalposts and under the crossbar, provided that no offense has been committed by the team scoring the goal.
> 
> - Law 10.1 Goal scored

Seeing green grass under the ball does not mean a goal has been scored. 

Be aware of these situations near a goal:

- The ball leaving/entering the nets through a hole [Example 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQZmRqxnH6M&ab_channel=TNTSports), [Example 2](https://www.tiktok.com/@refsneedlovetoo/video/7273154143399873838)
- The ball crossing the goal line but hitting the goal/netting support (backpost), water bottle, another ball or another object and returning to the field of play
- The ball hitting the goal net or goal/netting support (e.g. wheel) inside the goal but not completely crossing the goal line

While the assistant referee has the best view of the ball passing the goal line, the referee has the best view of the ball going between the goalposts and under the crossbar.

The team the goal is awarded to is determined by the coin toss before the match.

> - the referee tosses a coin and the team that wins the toss decides which goal to attack in the first half or to take the kick-off
> - depending on the above, their opponents take the kick-off or decide which goal to attack in the first half
> - the team that decided which goal to attack in the first half takes the kick-off to start the second half
> - for the second half, the teams change ends and attack the opposite goals
> 
> Law 8.1 Kick-off


## Offenses

If the defense commits an offense (e.g. handball) then the ball enters the goal, the goal still counts if the referee had not stopped play. Read more about advantage [here](/advantage).

Laws that will nullify a goal:

> If the ball becomes defective:
> - play is stopped and
> - restarted with a dropped ball
> 
> If the ball becomes defective at a kick-off, goal kick, corner kick, free kick, penalty kick or throw-in, the restart is retaken.
> 
> If the ball becomes defective during a penalty kick or kicks from the penalty mark as it moves forward and before it touches a player, crossbar or goalposts the penalty kick is retaken.
> - Law 2.2 Replacement of a defective ball

> The ball is out of play when:
> - it touches a match official, remains on the field of play and:
>   - a team starts a promising attack or
>   - the ball goes directly into the goal or
>   - the team in possession of the ball changes
> - In all these cases, play is restarted with a dropped ball.
>   
> Law 9.1 Ball out of play

- [No goal/dropped ball. The ball touches a match official then directly goes into the goal](https://youtu.be/MhWyCGQ9HDU)

> A player whose footwear or shinguard is lost accidentally must replace it as soon as possible and no later than when the ball next goes out of play; if before doing so the player plays the ball and/or scores a goal, the goal is awarded.
> - Law 4.2 Compulsory equipment

> An indirect free kick must be retaken if the referee fails to signal that the kick is indirect and the ball is kicked directly into the goal. 
> - Law 13.1 Types of free kick

> It is an offense if a player:
> - scores in the opponents’ goal:
>   - directly from their hand/arm, even if accidental, including by the goalkeeper
>   - immediately after the ball has touched their hand/arm, even if accidental
>     
> - Law 12.1 Direct free kick

> If the goalkeeper throws the ball directly into the opponents’ goal, a goal kick is awarded.
> - Law 10.1 Goal scored

> If a referee signals a goal before the ball has passed wholly over the goal line, play is restarted with a dropped ball. Law 10.1

In addition to the above, the [restarts](/restarts) section covers restart offenses. In summary, you can't directly score in the opponent's goal from a throw-in, indirect free kick else it's a goal kick. Also, you can't directly score in your own goal from any restart else it's a corner kick for your opponents. For dropped ball, the ball must be touched by two players else it's a goal kick if it enters the opponent's goal or it's a a corner kick if it enters your own goal.

## Extra person/outside interference

> If, after a goal is scored, the referee realises, before play restarts, that an extra person was on the field of play when the goal was scored, and that person interfered with play:
> 
> the referee must disallow the goal if the extra person was:
> - a player, substitute, substituted player, sent-off player or team official of the team that scored the goal; play is restarted with a direct free kick from the position of the extra person
> - an outside agent who interfered with play unless a goal results as outlined [..] in ‘Extra persons on the field of play’; play is restarted with a dropped ball
> - Law 3.9 Goal scored with an extra person on the field of play

If the ball goes into the goal but the ball touched a spectator or ball kid that enters the field of play to block the goal, the goal should generally stand.

> If a ball is going into the goal and the interference does not prevent a defending player playing the ball, the goal is awarded if the ball enters the goal (even if contact was made with the ball) unless the interference was by the attacking team.
> Law 3.7 Extra persons on the field of play

- [TODO - Super rare situation above. Does anyone have a video of it happening - send it in]

> If, after a goal is scored and play has restarted, the referee realises an extra person was on the field of play when the goal was scored, the goal cannot be disallowed. [..] The referee must report the incident to the appropriate authorities. Law 3.7

Similar idea applies above not only to extra people but to objects and animals. Any person not on the team lists, object (including extra ball), or animal is called an outside agent.

> Outside agent: Any animal, object or structure, etc., as well as any person who is not a match official or on the team list (players, substitutes and team officials) Glossary

> **Outside interference**
> - a spectator blows a whistle which interferes with play - play is stopped and restarted with a dropped ball
> - an extra ball, other object or animal enters the field of play during the match, the referee must:
>   - stop play (and restart with a dropped ball) only if it interferes with play - unless the ball is going into the goal and the interference does not prevent a defending player playing the ball, the goal is awarded if the ball enters the goal (even if contact was made with the ball) unless the interference was by the attacking team
>   - allow play to continue if it does not interfere with play and have it removed at the earliest possible opportunity
> Law 5.3 Powers and duties

## Goal signal

_Law 5.6 - Referee signals_ does not offer a signal for a goal or a kickoff. The unofficial but common signal is to point to the center circle where the kickoff will restart play. Personally, I make no hand signal. _The Guidelines for Match Officials_ recommends a whistle for a goal only when the ball appears still to be in play. 

_Law 6.6 - Assistant referee signals_ does not offer a signal for a goal or kickoff but _The Guidelines for Match Officials_ offers guidance.

> **Goal/no goal**
> 
> When a goal has been scored and there is no doubt about the decision, the referee and assistant referee must make eye contact and the assistant referee must then move quickly 25–30 metres along the touchline towards the halfway line without raising the flag.
> 
> When a goal has been scored but the ball appears still to be in play, the assistant referee must first raise the flag to attract the referee’s attention then continue with the normal goal procedure of running quickly 25–30 metres along the touchline towards the halfway line.
> 
> On occasions when the whole of the ball does not cross the goal line and play continues as normal because a goal has not been scored, the referee must make eye contact with the assistant referee and if necessary give a discreet hand signal.
> 
> - Guidelines for Match Officials 

- [The assistant referee should of raised their flag then run along the touchline rather than the referee stopping play to ask the assistant referee if the ball entered the goal. ](https://youtu.be/DK66w4_vBiI?t=701)
- [The assistant referee raises their flag then runs along the touch line on a not clear goal.](https://youtu.be/8XVcUWf562k?feature=shared&t=294)

## After a goal

It is accepted that referees do not add enough additional time, so the losing team or the team that just tied the game will try to retrieve the ball to restart play quickly while the other team will stall. No player is entitled to the ball after a goal and players must act responsibility. 

- [Should be double yellow card.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl6zluuAiwI&t=717s), [Should be double yellow card](https://youtu.be/ArwmdgVJHVU?feature=shared&t=331)

> **Celebration of a goal**
> 
> A player must be cautioned, even if the goal is disallowed, for:
> - climbing onto a perimeter fence and/or approaching the spectators in a manner which causes safety and/or security issues
> - acting in a provocative, derisory or inflammatory way
> - covering the head or face with a mask or other similar item
> - removing the shirt or covering the head with the shirt
> - Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

> - Law 8.1 Kick-off

## Winning team

> The team scoring the greater number of goals is the winner. If both teams score no goals or an equal number of goals, the match is drawn.
> 
> - Law 10.2 Winning team

Most matches where the score is tied will in a tie. The only exception is where competition rules require a winner.

> When competition rules require a winning team after a drawn match or home-and-away tie, the only permitted procedures to determine the winning team are:
> - away goals rule
> - two equal periods of extra time not exceeding 15 minutes each
> - penalties (penalty shoot-out)
>
> - Law 10.2 Winning team

> Away goals rule: goals scored away from home count double. Glossary

Penalties are covered in Law 10.3.
