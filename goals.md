## Anchored Goals

> Goals (including portable goals) must be firmly secured to the ground.
> 
> - Law 1.10 - Goals

## Goal Nets

> Nets may be attached to the goals and the ground behind the goal; they must be properly supported and must not interfere with the goalkeeper.
> 
> - Law 1.10 - Goals

Goal nets, esspecially in lower levels of the game, will have holes in them. Just because a ball is in the goal within the nets does noes mean that a goal has been scored. So, please aware of both of these situations:

- The ball enter the goals but leaves through the a hole in the net
- The ball enters the goal through a hole on the side of the net.

While the assistant referee has the best view of the ball passing the goal line, the referee has the best view that the ball goes between the goalposts and under the crossbar

## Ball off the crossbar or goalpost

Many shots will hit the crossbar or goalpost and remain in play.

> The ball is in play [,,,] when [the ball] rebounds off a goalpost, crossbar or corner flagpost and remains on the field of play.
>
> Law 9.2 Ball in play

## Goal scored

> A goal is scored when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, between the goalposts and under the crossbar, provided that no offence has been committed by the team scoring the goal.
> 
> - Law 10.1 - Goal scored

The team the goal is awarded to is determined by the coin toss before the match.

> - the referee tosses a coin and the team that wins the toss decides which goal to attack in the first half or to take the kick-off
> 
> - depending on the above, their opponents take the kick-off or decide which goal to attack in the first half
> 
> - the team that decided which goal to attack in the first half takes the kick-off to start the second half
> 
> - for the second half, the teams change ends and attack the opposite goals
> 
> - Law 8.1 Kick-off

## Goal Signal

Law 5.6 - Referee signals does not offer a signal for a goal or a kickoff. The unoffical but common signal is to point to the center circle where the kickoff will restart play. The Guidelines for Match Officals recommends a whistle to stop play for a a goal that is not clear.

> The whistle is NOT needed to:
> 
> - stop play for a clear:
>   
>   - goal kick, corner kick, throw-in or goal
> 
> - Guidelines for Match Officals

Law 6.6 - Assistant referee signals does not offer a signal for a goal or kickoff but the Guidlines for Match Officals offers guidance.

> [Assistant referees] indicate when:
> 
> - the whole of the ball leaves the field of play
> - Law 6.1 - Assistant referees

> **Goal/no goal**
> 
> When a goal has been scored and there is no doubt about the decision, the referee and assistant referee must make eye contact and the assistant referee must then move quickly 25–30 metres along the touchline towards the halfway line without raising the flag.
> 
> When a goal has been scored but the ball appears still to be in play, the assistant referee must first raise the flag to attract the referee’s attention then continue with the normal goal procedure of running quickly 25–30 metres along the touchline towards the halfway line.
> 
> On occasions when the whole of the ball does not cross the goal line and play continues as normal because a goal has not been scored, the referee must make eye contact with the assistant referee and if necessary give a discreet hand signal.
> 
> - Guidelines for Match Officals 

[The assistant referee should of raised their flag then run along the touchline rather than the referee stopping play to ask the assistant referee if the ball entered the goal. ](https://youtu.be/DK66w4_vBiI?t=701) 

## Fighting for the Ball After a Goal

 It is commonly accepted that referees do not add enough additional time, so the losing team or the team that just tied the game will try to retrieve the ball to restart play quickly while the other team will stall. No player is entitled to the ball after a goal and players must act responsibility. 

[The referee should of been present to stop the players from fighting for the ball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl6zluuAiwI&t=717s)

## Celebration of a goal

> A player must be cautioned, even if the goal is disallowed, for:
> 
> - climbing onto a perimeter fence and/or approaching the spectators in a manner which causes safety and/or security issues
> 
> - acting in a provocative, derisory or inflammatory way
> 
> - covering the head or face with a mask or other similar item
> 
> - removing the shirt or covering the head with the shirt
> 
> - Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

> 
> - Law 10.2 Winning team

For games that require a winner, I go into more detail about that in TODO.
