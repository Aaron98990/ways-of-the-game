## Injuries

Most grassroots games do not have medical personnel. When you beckon a non-medical personnel move away from the injured player and move away from the path that non-medical personnel has to get to the injured player. This is avoid confrontation or arguments.

Only allow one coach on the field for injuries if there are no medical trainers. Two or more and they just come in to cause problems. 

If the injury occurs, please go to the nearest match official and ask if they saw anything out of the ordinary. 



## Whistle tone

Short: Basic Offense, Restart play, Water break (with verbal announccement)
Long: unfair slide tackles, penalty kicks (ensure to wait for advantage), denying a goal, yellow or red cards
Short Short: Sub, Injury
Short Long: Halftime (including for extra time)
Short Shot Long: Abandon, Fulltime (including for extra time) or when penalties are complete

## Issuing cards

For any DOGSO-ish offfenses: consult AR

For yellow card or red card to one player: Ensure no advantage, do a long whistle, identify the player to card, ensure no quick restart goal scoring opportunity, pull out card and yell reason, while in the air look if already cautioned, write down info on card.

For cards to multiple players: Identify the players to card. Write first. Separate teams to their own bench or halves. Consult with AR if needed. Call players over. Show cards.

## After the game

Leave the field of play as soon as possible at intermissions (time between halves) and after the game. It causes less problems as I don't need to hear complains or additional paperwork and sanctions I issue after the game. All pleasentries should be done before kickoff or during half-time.

If a match report needs to be signed or returned - leave the field and fill it out next to your stuff. 

## Assistant referees

Deflection: Yell deflection and wave flag while signaling restart (I will also make a deflection symbol when I see it)

Offside: For delebiterate play, I will yell defender or deliberate.

Call all offenses/fouls immediatly (including obvious ones, where I'm in the area, and in penalty area) - I will decide advantage. Push offs and holding on the other side of the field you may see - call it and yell Aaron.

For any offense which is card worthy: Raise flag up, yell if needed, and let's talk about it

For all dissent: use options (warning/card, move/remove person)
