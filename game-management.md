This is subjective - each referee has their own style and there is no right or wrong. I am writing about my own style.

## Injuries

Most grassroots games do not have medical personnel. When you beckon a non-medical personnel move away from the injured player and move away from the path that non-medical personnel has to get to the injured player. This is avoid confrontation or arguments.

If the injury occurs, please go to the nearest match official and ask if they saw anything out of the ordinary. 


## Issuing cards

Most referees issue the card then write. In games without a sin bin, I am a proponent of being the player for a conference while writing their information then showing the card.

There is this awkward time where you spend 15 seconds writing and everyone is waiting for you giving a chance for people to complain.

## After the game

Most referees like to stay on the field but I prefer to leave the field of play as soon as possible. It causes less problems as I don't need to hear complains or additional paperwork and sanctions I issue after the game. All pleasentries should be done before kickoff or during half-time.

If a match report needs to be signed or returned - leave the field and fill it out next to your stuff. 

## Assistant referees

Ball out of bounds: Y for deflection. For direction, hold hand in correct hand but to opposing leg. I don't know - hand on opposing shoulder.

No need to wait for me to make first go ever for fouls. Push offs and holding on the other side of the field you may see - call it yell Aaron.

For every foul: I don't know - hand on opposing shoulder.

No card - arm in L pointed down 90 degrees.

YC - arm in L pointed up 90 degrres.

RC - elbow up then arm across head 90 degrees.

For all dissent: you always have the final say.
