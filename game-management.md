## Injuries

Most grassroots games do not have medical personnel. When you beckon a non-medical personnel move away from the injured player and move away from the path that non-medical personnel has to get to the injured player. This is avoid confrontation or arguments.

If the injury occurs, please go to the nearest match official and ask if they saw anything out of the ordinary. 

## Consult with the player

For all slide tackles which are deemed unfair, have a conference with that player even if not givning a sanction.

## Whistle tone

Normal: Foul, Restart play
Long: unfair slide tackles, penalty kicks, yellow or red cards

## Issuing cards

For any DOGSO-ish offfenses: consult AR

For yellow card or red card to one player: Ensure no advantage, do a long whistle, identify the player to card, ensure no quick restart goal scoring opportunity, pull out card and yell reason, while in the air look at the card to see if they have already carded and if so show the second yellow card, write down info on card.

For cards to multiple players: Identify the players to card. Write first. Separate teams to their own bench or halves. Consult with AR if needed. Call players over. Show cards.

## After the game

Leave the field of play as soon as possible at intermissions (time between halves) and after the game. It causes less problems as I don't need to hear complains or additional paperwork and sanctions I issue after the game. All pleasentries should be done before kickoff or during half-time.

If a match report needs to be signed or returned - leave the field and fill it out next to your stuff. 

## Assistant referees

Deflection: Yell deflection and wave flag while signaling restart

No need to wait for me to make first go ever for fouls. Push offs and holding on the other side of the field you may see - call it yell Aaron.

For all dissent: you always have the final say.
