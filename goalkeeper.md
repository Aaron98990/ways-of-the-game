["Football Rules" great summary of the Laws about goalkeepers.](https://footballrules.com/participants/goalkeepers)

Each team must always have one goalkeeper. 

> A match is played by two teams, each with a maximum of eleven players; one must be the goalkeeper. _Law 3.1 Number of players_

## Goalkeeper equipment

Goalkeepers may wear caps. Any player, including goalkeepers, can wear gloves - there are no size, color, or stickiness restrictions on gloves.

> Non-dangerous protective equipment, for example gloves, headgear, facemasks and knee and arm protectors made of soft, lightweight padded material is permitted, as are goalkeepers’ caps and sports spectacles. Goalkeepers may wear tracksuit bottoms. _Law 4.4_

Goalkeepers must be distinguishable from other players and the match officials. 

> - The two teams must wear colours that distinguish them from each other and the match officials
> - Each goalkeeper must wear colours that are distinguishable from the other players and the match officials
> - If the two goalkeepers’ shirts are the same colour and neither has another shirt, the referee allows the match to be played _Law 4.3 Colours_

## Boxing out the goalkeeper

On corner kicks, players stand in front of the goalkeeper to limit their movement and sight. This is allowed if no other offense is being committed. Referees should warn player doing this that they commit an offense if they move into the path of the goalkeeper or hold them.

> Impeding the progress of an opponent means moving into the opponent’s path to obstruct, block, slow down or force a change of direction when the ball is not within playing distance of either player.
> 
> All players have a right to their position on the field of play; being in the way of an opponent is not the same as moving into the way of an opponent. _Law 12.2_

If the offense involves contact with the goalkeeper, the restart is a direct free kick. Else, the restart is an indirect free kick.

> - the referee is informed before the change is made
> - the change is made during a stoppage in play
> - 3.4 Changing the goalkeeper

> If a player changes places with the goalkeeper without the referee’s permission, the referee:

## Outside their penalty area

Goalkeepers can go anywhere on the field of play and take any restart (e.g. throw-ins) if it belongs to their team. A goalkeeper committing a handball offense outside their own penalty area is just like any other non-goalkeeper player, a direct free kick with the appropriate sanction / disciplinary action is taken (Law 12.1). Read more in the [handball section](/handball).

> The goalkeeper has the same restrictions on handling the ball as any other player outside the penalty area. Law 12.1

- [The goalkeeper commits a handball offense outside their penalty area. A direct free kick and a red card for DOGSO are the correct outcomes just like a non-goalkeeper.](https://youtu.be/uzZnBPHsx_0?t=107)
- [Goalkeeper takes a throw-in.](https://youtu.be/i9o1w6tu870?feature=shared&t=3)

## Inside their penalty area

Handball is often thought of a direct free kick offense. But the Laws of the game does provide one exception "for the goalkeeper within their penalty area" as shown below in parentheses.

> A direct free kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offenses:
> - a handball offense (except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area)
> - Law 12.2 Direct free kick

The goalkeeper committing an offense with their hand/arm in their own penalty area (eight seconds, after releasing, "backpass", goalkeeper handles the ball directly after taking a restart) is always an indirect free kick (not a penalty kick) as shown in the [restarts section](/restarts?id=indirect-free-kick). Also, no sanction and no disciplinary action is taken unless the goalkeeper handles the ball directly after taking a restart.

> If the goalkeeper handles the ball inside their penalty area when not permitted to do so, an indirect free kick is awarded but there is no disciplinary sanction. However, if the offense is playing the ball a second time (with or without the hand/arm) after a restart before it touches another player, the goalkeeper must be sanctioned if the offense stops a promising attack or denies an opponent or the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity. _Law 12.1 Direct free kick_

## Control with hand/arms

> A goalkeeper is in control of the ball with the hand(s) when:
> - the ball is between the hands or between the hand and any surface (e.g. ground, own body) or by touching it with any part of the hands or arms, except if the ball rebounds from the goalkeeper or the goalkeeper has made a save
> - holding the ball in the outstretched open hand
> - bouncing it on the ground or throwing it in the air
> 
> A goalkeeper cannot be challenged by an opponent when in control of the ball with the hand(s). _Law 12.3_

> If an offense involves contact, it is penalised by a direct free kick _Law 12.1_

If the offense involves contact with the goalkeeper, it is a direct free kick. Else, it is an indirect free kick.
- [Foul. Direct free kick since it involved contact. The player challenges the goalkeeper for the ball. This may have been a legal challenge if the goalkeeper was not in control of the ball with the hands. ](https://www.tiktok.com/@refsneedlovetoo/video/7269070487970450734)
- [Foul. Indirect free kick since the offense involved contact with the ball not the player after the goalkeeper has two hands on the ball and its not a rebound. ](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZPRW7popf/)
- [Foul. Indirect free kick since the offense involved no contact with the goalkeeper and only the ball. The goalkeeper is in control of the ball when bouncing the ball.](https://youtu.be/vNOd5LPVUcw?feature=shared&t=35)
- [No foul - Goal. The goalkeeper's team-mate, not their opponent, challenges them for the ball](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZPRW7n6RJ/)
- [Foul + YC. The goalkeeper is recklessly kicked in the chest and the attacker made no attempt to pull out.](https://youtu.be/w5QBxc2Hq0o?feature=shared&t=5166)

<!-- A goalkeeper cannot push an opponent with the ball while in control with the hand/arms else it's a penalty kick for the goalkeeper's opponents - but generally this is retaliation for the first foul by the opposing team (e.g. impeding/charging) -->

<!-- 1) If the goalkeeper either intentionally strikes
an opponent by throwing the ball vigorously at him
or pushes him with the ball while holding it, the
referee shall award a penalty-kick, if the offence
took place within the penalty-area . Laws of the Game 1990/91 -->

When the goalkeeper is in control of the ball with their hand/arms, there is no reason for any player to approach, impede, or make contact with the goalkeeper or the ball. Referees must be firm on this - including using cautions or send-offs or using preventative refereeing as these are bad-faith plays that may lead to confrontation. If the goaleeper retailates, the first foul is called.

## Releasing the ball

While the goalkeeper is releasing the ball, remember that the boundary lines that makes the penalty area is part of the penalty area (see Law 1.2 quote below). A goalkeeper commits no offense when they have their body outside their own penalty area but the ball is making contact with their hands only in their own penalty area (including above the boundary lines that make the penalty area). Also, no offense if committed if their momentum from releasing the ball takes them out of the penalty area if hand/arm contact with the ball only occurred in their penalty area.

- [No offense. Goalkeeper did not contact the ball with their hand/arm outside the penalty area.](https://youtu.be/2rXfqVkmMII?feature=shared&t=375)

> lines belong to the areas of which they are boundaries. _Law 1.2 - Field Markings_

> An indirect free kick is awarded if a player:
> - prevents the goalkeeper from releasing the ball from the hands or kicks or attempts to kick the ball when the goalkeeper is in the process of releasing it

- [Indirect free kick. Player kicks ball while goalkeeper is releasing it. Generally, a non-mandatory yellow card is given because of how blatant it is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm0SBD5Pfd0)
- [Indirect free kick. Player attempts to head the ball while goalkeeper is releasing the ball from the hands. Generally, a non-mandatory yellow card is given because of how blatant it is.](https://youtu.be/matwhFahR2Q?feature=shared&t=405)

A goalkeeper that directly throws the ball from their own penalty area into the opposing goal is a goal kick for their opponents (Law 10.1). 

## Eight Seconds

> A corner kick is awarded if a goalkeeper, inside their penalty area, controls the ball with their hand(s)/arm(s) for more than eight seconds before releasing it.
>
> The referee will decide when the goalkeeper has control of the ball and the eight seconds begin and will visually count down the last five seconds with a raised hand.
>  _Law 12.3_

Verbal countdown also recommended. Personally, I would say countdown to negative two then punish the offense as I'm not looking to punish this. Referees should also remember the skill level of the players and the score of the game, when enforcing the rule. There is no sanction for this.

## After releasing

> An indirect free kick is awarded if a goalkeeper, inside their penalty area, commits any of the following offenses:
> - touches the ball with the hand/arm after releasing it and before it has touched another player _Law 12.2_

If the ball rebounds off a goalkeeper hand/arms or any part of the body, they have never released the ball. To release the ball the goalkeeper must be in control with the hand/arms (defined below) and rebounds (deliberate or not) do not count. 

- [Indirect free kick. Goalkeeper controls ball with hard/arms, releases it, and then touches ball with hands/arms again](https://www.tiktok.com/@refsneedlovetoo/video/7214189038956252459)
- [No offense. As defined in the control with hands section, a rebound (including when deliberate) does not constitute control with the hand/arms.](https://youtu.be/kJcR7CNMdQc?feature=shared&t=2528)

## "Backpass"

"Goalkeeper backpass" is the unofficial, but commonly used term when the goalkeeper handles the ball when not supposed after passed from a team-mate.

> An indirect free kick is awarded if a goalkeeper, inside their penalty area, commits any of the following offenses:
> - touches the ball with the hand/arm, unless the goalkeeper has clearly kicked or attempted to kick the ball to release it into play, after:
>   - it has been deliberately kicked to the goalkeeper by a team-mate
>   - receiving it directly from a throw-in taken by a team-mate
> - Law 12.2 Indirect free kick

A kick is defined in the Laws of the Game.

> Kick: The ball is kicked when a player makes contact with it with the foot and/or the ankle
> - Glossary - Football terms

A player that heads, knees, chests, or use the area between the knee and ankle (shin) the ball to their goalkeeper to pick up with their hands without using a trick to circumvent the Laws then no offense has been committed.
- [No offense. The ball is kneed - not kicked - to the goalkeeper by a team-mate.](https://youtu.be/t10lSBuTQYY?t=104)
- [No offense. The ball was headed - not kicked - to the goalkeeper by a team-mate.](https://www.youtube.com/live/OFbyNU6UQQs?feature=share&t=614)

If there is any doubt in the referee's mind, it should not be called. These would not be "goalkeeper backpass":
- the ball comes from a deflection from any player
  - [No offense. The ball comes from a deflection.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7esEwniKXqQ)
- the ball was meant for a different player or no one (e.g. kicking the ball away)
  - [No offense. The ball is deliberately kicked to no one. No one can say with 100% certainty that the ball was meant for the goalkeeper.](https://youtu.be/w5QBxc2Hq0o?feature=shared&t=5397)
- the ball was kicked to by an opponent
  - [No offense. The goalkeeper can still pick the ball up after kicking it around since it came from an opponent.](https://youtu.be/kFkFtgqXiO4?t=726) 

The "backpass" law gives an exception: 

> [..]the goalkeeper has clearly kicked or attempted to kick the ball to release it into play

 Please note an attempt to kick the ball to continue dribbling (and not releasing it to play) does not meet the exception. Also, an attempt to throw the ball does not meet the exception.
- [No offense. Goalkeeper attempts to kick the ball to release the ball into play. Therefore, they can pick up the ball.](https://youtu.be/pDhRUUha6B0?feature=shared&t=194)

## Circumventing the "backpass" Law

> An indirect free kick is awarded if a player:
> - initiates a deliberate trick for the ball to be passed (including from a free kick or goal kick) to the goalkeeper with the head, chest, knee etc. to circumvent the Law, whether or not the goalkeeper touches the ball with the hands; the goalkeeper is penalised if responsible for initiating the deliberate trick _Law 12.2_

> There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behavior including if a player:
> - initiates a deliberate trick for the ball to be passed (including from a free kick or goal kick) to the goalkeeper with the head, chest, knee etc. to circumvent the Law, whether or not the goalkeeper touches the ball with the hands; the goalkeeper is cautioned if responsible for initiating the deliberate trick _Law 12.3_

This offense is an indirect free kick and caution for unsporting behavior. Note that initiating the deliberate trick is the offense, whether or not the goalkeeper picks up the ball or attempts to pick up the ball does not matter.
