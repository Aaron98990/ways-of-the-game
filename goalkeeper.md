A goalkeeper is a fundamental part of the game. Each team must always have one goalkeeper.

## Goalkeeper handball

The goalkeeper commiting a handball offense in their own penalty area and there are no other offenses is always an indirect free kick and no sanction and no disciplinary action is taken. 

A goalkeeper commiting a handball offense outside their own penalty area is just like any other non-goalkeeper player, a direct free kick with the appropiate sanction / disciplinary action (SPA, Persistent Offenses, Lack of Respect for the Game, or DOGSO) is taken.

### Outside the goalkeeper's own penalty area

> The goalkeeper has the same restrictions on handling the ball as any other player outside the penalty area.
> 
> - Law 12.1 Direct free kick

The Law should probably read "outside the goalkeeper's penalty area" but is still correct. Read more in TODO section.

#### Releasing the ball

While the goalkeeper is releasing the ball, remember that the boundary lines that makes the penalty area is considered to be part of the penalty area. A goalkeeper commits no offense when they have their body outside their own penalty area but the ball is making contact with their hands in their own penalty area (including above the boundary lines that make the penalty area). Also, no offense if commited if their momentum from releasing the ball takes them out of the penalty area if hand/arm contact with the ball only occured in their penalty area.

> An indirect free kick is awarded if a player:
> 
> - prevents the goalkeeper from releasing the ball from the hands or kicks or attempts to kick the ball when the goalkeeper is in the process of releasing it

### Inside the goalkeeper's own penalty area

Handball is often thought of a direct free kick offense. But, the Laws of the game does provide one exception.

> A direct free kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offences:
> - a handball offence (except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area)
> Law 12.2 Direct free kick

Please note the exception "except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area." Goalkeeper handball - goalkeeper offenses related to touching or controlling the ball with the hand/arm - inside their own penalty area is governed by these laws quoted below.

> An indirect free kick is awarded if a goalkeeper, inside their penalty area, commits any of the following offences:
> 
> - controls the ball with the hand/arm for more than six seconds before releasing it
> 
> - touches the ball with the hand/arm after releasing it and before it has touched another player
> 
> - touches the ball with the hand/arm, unless the goalkeeper has clearly kicked or attempted to kick the ball to release it into play, after:
>   
>   - it has been deliberately kicked to the goalkeeper by a team-mate
>   
>   - receiving it directly from a throw-in taken by a team-mate
> 
> - Law 12.2 Indirect free kick

A kick is defined in the Laws of the Game. It is quite a lot so lets take it in. 

> Kick
> 
> The ball is kicked when a player makes contact with it with the foot and/or the ankle
> 
> - Glossary - Football terms

A player that heads, knees, chests, or use the area between the knee and ancle (shin) the ball to their goalkeeper to pick up with their hands without using a trick to circumvent the Laws then no offfense has been commited.

[No offense. The ball is kneed - not kicked - to the goalkeeper by a team-mate.](https://youtu.be/t10lSBuTQYY?t=104)

[No offense. The ball was headed - not kicked - to the goalkeeper by a team-mate.](https://www.youtube.com/live/OFbyNU6UQQs?feature=share&t=614)

It is accepted to not call the "controls the ball with the hand/arm for more than six seconds before releasing it" unless several warnings are given and until at least 15 seconds of control with the hand/arm - it is meant only for egregious cases. Referees should also remember the skill level of the players and the score of the game, when enforcing the rule.

"Deliberately kicked to the goalkeeper by a team-mate" is often unoffically called "goalkeeper passback" and has a high standard to meet because as a referee there is no way to read the player's mind. If there is any doubt in the referee's mind, it should not be called. These would not meet the standard of a "deliberate kick to the goalkeeper":

- the ball comes from a deflection from any player
- the ball was meant for a different player

[The ball is deliberately kicked to the goalkeeper by a team-mate. The goalkeeper would commit an offense if they picked the ball up.](https://www.youtube.com/live/OFbyNU6UQQs?feature=share&t=857)

The law gives exception to "the goalkeeper has clearly kicked or attempted to kick the ball to release it into play" for goalkeeper handball. Please note an attempt to kick the ball without releasing it to play does not meet the exception.

[The ball is deliberately kicked to the goalkeeper by a team-mate. At this point, the goalkeeper would commit an offense if they picked the ball up. The goalkeeper then attempts to kick the ball to realse into play. Now, the goalkeeper would be able to pick up the ball.](https://youtu.be/V-tSSbnHSVM)

#### Indirect Free Kick in Opponents' Penalty Area

Remember only direct free kick offenses may lead to a penalty kick.

> A penalty kick is awarded if a player commits a direct free kick offence inside their penalty area or off the field as part of play as outlined in Laws 12 and 13.
>
> Law 14 Penalty Kick

Some players call indirect free kicks "two touches" becuase it requires a touch from two different players. The indirect free kick taker can't touch the ball twice in a row. Goalkeeper handball in their own penalty area is an indirect free kick.

> if an indirect free kick is kicked directly into the opponentsâ€™ goal, a goal kick is awarded
>
> Law 13 Free Kicks

That unoffical signal for offside with the referee raising their hand straight up is the signal for indirect free kicks. It's rare to see a goal or a direct attempt at goal from a restart due to offside since it is usually more than halfway accross the field.

> The referee indicates an indirect free kick by raising the arm above the head; this signal is maintained until the kick has been taken and the ball touches another player, goes out of play or it is clear that a goal cannot be scored directly.
>
> Law 13 Free Kicks

Remember the following:

> indirect free kicks to the attacking team for an offence inside the opponentsâ€™ goal area are taken from the nearest point on the goal area line which runs parallel to the goal line
>
> The ball:
>
> is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves
> 
> Until the ball is in play, all opponents must remain:
> 
> at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the ball, unless they are on their own goal line between the goalposts
> 
> Law 13 Free Kicks

I personally do not allow quick indrect free kicks in the penalty area. It is too much chaos. At lower levels of the game, players should be reminded that two touches of the ball is needed before going in the goal.

[Example 1: The referee has their hand up. All opponents are on the goal line between the goalposts since they are less than 10 yds from the ball.](https://youtu.be/57Gs6vLMnvU?t=25)

[Example 2: The referee has their hand up. All opponents are on the goal line between the goalposts since they are less than 10 yds from the ball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARC-zVHgsA8)

We defined a kick before and lets define it again. The ball must be "kicked and clearly moves".

> Kick
> 
> The ball is kicked when a player makes contact with it with the foot and/or the ankle
> 
> - Glossary - Football terms

If a player taps the ball with the bottom of their boot, that is a kick. Now, "clearly moves" is more subjective. The ball must not just move, it must clearly move. In these situations, you have the free kick taker take the smallest of touches before a second player kicks it at the goal. To who must it be the clear the ball moves. It is subjective and I offer this advice to you - follow the spirit of the game. ðŸ˜†

#### Disciplinary Action

Unless the goalkeeper commits a more serious offense at the same time (talked about in the next section), a goalkeeper can not be cautioned or sent off for handling the ball in their own penalty area. This includes if the referee determined that the goalkeeper's offense is Persistent Offenses or Stopped a Promising Attack (SPA) or Denied an Obvious Goal Scoring Opportunity (DOGSO) - this is where the "except a goalkeeper within their penalty area" exception in the disciplinary action section comes from.

> A player, substitute or substituted player who commits any of the following offences is sent off:
> 
> - denying the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by a handball offence (except a goalkeeper within their penalty area)
> 
> - Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

Weirldy enough, they do not add it for Persistent Offeneses or Stopping a Promising Attack by handball although "(except a goalkeeper within their penalty area)" still applies. 

> There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour including if a player:
> 
> - handles the ball to interfere with or stop a promising attack
> 
> - Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

#### Two Offenses at Once

> If the goalkeeper handles the ball inside their penalty area when not permitted to do so, an indirect free kick is awarded but there is no disciplinary sanction. However, if the offence is playing the ball a second time (with or without the hand/arm) after a restart before it touches another player, the goalkeeper must be sanctioned if the offence stops a promising attack or denies an opponent or the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity.
> 
> - Law 12.1 Direct free kick

This is a bit confusing to read. Let me summarize. 

If the goalkeeper takes the free kick or goal kick or throw-in (or even a kick-off) then handles the ball inside their own penalty area before the ball has touched another player, they have commited two offeneses at the same time:

- > If, after the ball is in play, the kicker touches the ball again before it has touched another player, an indirect free kick is awarded
  > 
  > - Law 16.2, 13.2 Offenses and Sancctions

- > An indirect free kick is awarded if a goalkeeper, inside their penalty area, commits any of the following offences:
  > 
  > - touches the ball with the hand/arm, unless the goalkeeper has clearly kicked or attempted to kick the ball to release it into play, after:
  >   
  >   - it has been deliberately kicked to the goalkeeper by a team-mate
  >   
  >   - receiving it directly from a throw-in taken by a team-mate
  > 
  > - Law 12.2 Indirect Free Kick

Team-mate in the Laws of the Game includes passing it to oneself. Both offeneses have the same restart, an indirect free kick. But, the double touch allows a player to be cautioned or sent off while the goalkeeper handball in their own penalty area does not - so we punish the more serious offense - the one with a higher sanction (caution/send-off). So, in the eyes of the Law - the goalkeeper only commited the double touch offense. This clarification is really just an extension of another Law written out to be clear.

> The referee:
> 
> - punishes the more serious offence, in terms of sanction, restart, physical severity and tactical impact, when more than one offence occurs at the same time
> 
> - Law 5.3 - Powers and duties

#### Circumventing the Law

> - initiates a deliberate trick for the ball to be passed (including from a free kick or goal kick) to the goalkeeper with the head, chest, knee etc. to circumvent the Law, whether or not the goalkeeper touches the ball with the hands; the goalkeeper is penalised if responsible for initiating the deliberate trick
> - Law 12.2 Indirect free kick 

> There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour including if a player:
> 
> - initiates a deliberate trick for the ball to be passed (including from a free kick or goal kick) to the goalkeeper with the head, chest, knee etc. to circumvent the Law, whether or not the goalkeeper touches the ball with the hands; the goalkeeper is cautioned if responsible for initiating the deliberate trick
> - Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

Note that initiating the deliberate trick is the offense, whether or not the goalkeeper picks up the ball or attempts to pick up the ball does not matter.

## Control with hand/arms

Goaleeper in Control of the Ball with the Hands

A go

> A goalkeeper is considered to be in control of the ball with the hand(s) when:
> 
> - the ball is between the hands or between the hand and any surface (e.g. ground, own body) or by touching it with any part of the hands or arms, except if the ball rebounds from the goalkeeper or the goalkeeper has made a save
> 
> - holding the ball in the outstretched open hand
> 
> - bouncing it on the ground or throwing it in the air

> ## Boxing out the goalkeeper

On corner kicks, players stand in front of the goalkeeper.


## Is the goalkeeper protected too much?

Some people will say that the goalkeeper is protected too much. In reality, referees are applying the rules. Goalkeepers will have greater playing distances than non-goal-keepers because they can catch / punt the ball with their hands.

> Playing distance
> 
> Distance to the ball which allows a player to touch the ball by extending the foot/leg or jumping or, for goalkeepers, jumping with arms extended. Distance depends on the physical size of the player
> 
> Glossary

## Changing the goalkeeper

> Any of the players may change places with the goalkeeper if:
>
> the referee is informed before the change is made
>
> the change is made during a stoppage in play
> 3.4 Changing the goalkeeper

What is the offense of disobeying this?

> If a player changes places with the goalkeeper without the refereeâ€™s permission, the referee:
>
> allows play to continue
>
> cautions both players when the ball is next out of play but not if the change occurred during half-time (including half-time of extra time) or the period between the end of the match and the start of extra time and/or penalties (penalty shoot-out)
> 3.5 Offences and sanctions
