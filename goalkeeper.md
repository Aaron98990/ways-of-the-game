["Football Rules" great summary of the Laws about goalkeepers.](https://footballrules.com/participants/goalkeepers)

A goalkeeper is a fundamental part of the game. Each team must always have one goalkeeper. 

> A match is played by two teams, each with a maximum of eleven players; one must be the goalkeeper.
> 3.1 Number of players

## Goalkeeper equipment

Goalkeepers may wear tracksuit bottoms and caps. Any player, including goalkeepers, can wear gloves - there are no size restrictions on gloves.

> Goalkeepers may wear tracksuit bottoms.[...] Non-dangerous protective equipment, for example headgear, facemasks and knee and arm protectors made of soft, lightweight padded material is permitted, as are goalkeepers’ caps and sports spectacles.
> - Law 4

Goalkeepers must be distinguishable from other players and the match officials. 

> - The two teams must wear colours that distinguish them from each other and the match officials
> - Each goalkeeper must wear colours that are distinguishable from the other players and the match officials
> - If the two goalkeepers’ shirts are the same colour and neither has another shirt, the referee allows the match to be played
> - Law 4

## Boxing out the goalkeeper

On corner kicks, players stand in front of the goalkeeper to limit their movement and sight. This is allowed if no other offense is being committed. Referees should warn player doing this that they commit an offense if they move into the path of the goalkeeper.

> Impeding the progress of an opponent means moving into the opponent’s path to obstruct, block, slow down or force a change of direction when the ball is not within playing distance of either player.
> 
> All players have a right to their position on the field of play; being in the way of an opponent is not the same as moving into the way of an opponent.
> - Law 12.2

If the offense involves contact with the goalkeeper, the restart is a direct free kick. Else, the restart is an indirect free kick.

## Playing distance

Some people will say that the goalkeeper is protected too much. In reality, referees are applying the rules. Goalkeepers will have greater playing distances than non-goalkeepers because they can use their arms/hands to catch/save the ball inside their penalty area.

> Playing distance: Distance to the ball which allows a player to touch the ball by extending the foot/leg or jumping or, for goalkeepers, jumping with arms extended. Distance depends on the physical size of the player
> - Glossary

## Changing the goalkeeper

> Any of the players may change places with the goalkeeper if:
> - the referee is informed before the change is made
> - the change is made during a stoppage in play
> - 3.4 Changing the goalkeeper

> If a player changes places with the goalkeeper without the referee’s permission, the referee:
> - allows play to continue
> - cautions both players when the ball is next out of play but not if the change occurred during half-time (including half-time of extra time) or the period between the end of the match and the start of extra time and/or penalties (penalty shoot-out)
> - 3.5 Offenses and sanctions

## Outside their penalty area

Goalkeepers can go anywhere on the field of play and take any restart (e.g. throw-ins) if it belongs to their team. A goalkeeper committing a handball offense outside their own penalty area is just like any other non-goalkeeper player, a direct free kick with the appropriate sanction / disciplinary action is taken (Law 12.1). Read more in the [handball section](/handball).

> The goalkeeper has the same restrictions on handling the ball as any other player outside the penalty area. Law 12.1

- [The goalkeeper commits a handball offense outside their penalty area. A direct free kick and a red card for DOGSO are the correct outcomes just like a non-goalkeeper.](https://youtu.be/uzZnBPHsx_0?t=107)
- [Goalkeeper takes a throw-in.](https://youtu.be/i9o1w6tu870?feature=shared&t=3)

## Inside their penalty area

Handball is often thought of a direct free kick offense. But the Laws of the game does provide one exception "for the goalkeeper within their penalty area".

> A direct free kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offenses:
> - a handball offense (except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area)
> - Law 12.2 Direct free kick

The goalkeeper committing a handball offense in their own penalty area (six seconds, after releasing, "backpass") is always an indirect free kick (not a penalty kick) and no sanction and no disciplinary action is taken unless the goalkeeper touches the ball directly after taking a restart, a goalkeeper can be penalised and carded for that offense.

> If the goalkeeper handles the ball inside their penalty area when not permitted to do so, an indirect free kick is awarded but there is no disciplinary sanction. However, if the offense is playing the ball a second time (with or without the hand/arm) after a restart before it touches another player, the goalkeeper must be sanctioned if the offense stops a promising attack or denies an opponent or the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity.
> - Law 12.1 Direct free kick

A goalkeeper that directly throws the ball from their own penalty area into the opposing goal is a goal kick for their opponents (Law 10.1). 

## Control with hand/arms

> A goalkeeper cannot be challenged by an opponent when in control of the ball with the hand(s).
>
> A goalkeeper is in control of the ball with the hand(s) when:
> - the ball is between the hands or between the hand and any surface (e.g. ground, own body) or by touching it with any part of the hands or arms, except if the ball rebounds from the goalkeeper or the goalkeeper has made a save
> - holding the ball in the outstretched open hand
> - bouncing it on the ground or throwing it in the air

If the offense involves contact with the goalkeeper, it is a direct free kick. Else, it is an indirect free kick.
- [Foul. Direct free kick since it involved contact. The player challenges the goalkeeper for the ball. This may have been a legal challenge if the goalkeeper was not in control of the ball with the hands. ](https://www.tiktok.com/@refsneedlovetoo/video/7269070487970450734)
- [Foul. Indirect free kick since the offense involved contact with the ball not the player after the goalkeeper has two hands on the ball and its not a rebound. ](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZPRW7popf/)
- [Foul. Indirect free kick since the offense involved no contact with the goalkeeper and only the ball. The goalkeeper is in control of the ball when bouncing the ball.](https://youtu.be/vNOd5LPVUcw?feature=shared&t=35)
- [No foul - Goal. The goalkeeper's team-mate, not their opponent, challenges them for the ball](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZPRW7n6RJ/)

## Releasing the ball

While the goalkeeper is releasing the ball, remember that the boundary lines that makes the penalty area is part of the penalty area. A goalkeeper commits no offense when they have their body outside their own penalty area but the ball is making contact with their hands in their own penalty area (including above the boundary lines that make the penalty area). Also, no offense if committed if their momentum from releasing the ball takes them out of the penalty area if hand/arm contact with the ball only occurred in their penalty area.

> lines belong to the areas of which they are boundaries.
> - Law 1.2 - Field Markings

> An indirect free kick is awarded if a player:
> - prevents the goalkeeper from releasing the ball from the hands or kicks or attempts to kick the ball when the goalkeeper is in the process of releasing it

- [Indirect free kick. Player kicks ball while goalkeeper is releasing it. Generally, a non-mandatory yellow card is given because of how blatant it is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm0SBD5Pfd0)
- [Indirect free kick. Player attempts to head the ball while goalkeeper is releasing the ball from the hands. Generally, a non-mandatory yellow card is given because of how blatant it is.]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm0SBD5Pfd0](https://youtu.be/matwhFahR2Q?feature=shared&t=405))

## Six seconds and after releasing

> An indirect free kick is awarded if a goalkeeper, inside their penalty area, commits any of the following offenses:
> - controls the ball with the hand/arm for more than six seconds before releasing it
> - touches the ball with the hand/arm after releasing it and before it has touched another player

It is ~~accepted~~ expected to not call the "controls the ball with the hand/arm for more than six seconds before releasing it" unless several warnings are given and until at least 15 seconds of control with the hand/arm - it is meant only for egregious/blatant cases. Referees should also remember the skill level of the players and the score of the game, when enforcing the rule.

If the ball rebounds off a goalkeeper hand/arms or any part of the body, they have never released the ball. To release the ball the goalkeeper must be in control with the hand/arms (defined below) and rebounds (deliberate or not) do not count. 

- [Indirect free kick. Goalkeeper controls ball with hard/arms, releases it, and then touches ball with hands/arms again](https://www.tiktok.com/@refsneedlovetoo/video/7214189038956252459)
- [No offense. As defined in the control with hands section, a rebound (including when deliberate) does not constitute control with the hand/arms. ](https://youtu.be/kJcR7CNMdQc?feature=shared&t=2528)

## "Backpass"

"Goalkeeper backpass" is the unofficial, but commonly used term when the goalkeeper handles the ball when not supposed after passed from a team-mate.

> An indirect free kick is awarded if a goalkeeper, inside their penalty area, commits any of the following offenses:
> - touches the ball with the hand/arm, unless the goalkeeper has clearly kicked or attempted to kick the ball to release it into play, after:
>   - it has been deliberately kicked to the goalkeeper by a team-mate
>   - receiving it directly from a throw-in taken by a team-mate
> - Law 12.2 Indirect free kick

A kick is defined in the Laws of the Game.

> Kick: The ball is kicked when a player makes contact with it with the foot and/or the ankle
> - Glossary - Football terms

A player that heads, knees, chests, or use the area between the knee and ankle (shin) the ball to their goalkeeper to pick up with their hands without using a trick to circumvent the Laws then no offense has been committed.
- [No offense. The ball is kneed - not kicked - to the goalkeeper by a team-mate.](https://youtu.be/t10lSBuTQYY?t=104)
- [No offense. The ball was headed - not kicked - to the goalkeeper by a team-mate.](https://www.youtube.com/live/OFbyNU6UQQs?feature=share&t=614)

If there is any doubt in the referee's mind, it should not be called. These would not be "goalkeeper backpass":
- the ball comes from a deflection from any player
  - [No offense. The ball comes from a deflection.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7esEwniKXqQ)
- the ball was meant for a different player
- the ball was kicked to by an opponent
  - [No offense. The goalkeeper can still pick the ball up after kicking it around since it came from an opponent.](https://youtu.be/kFkFtgqXiO4?t=726) 

The "backpass" law gives an exception: "the goalkeeper has clearly kicked or attempted to kick the ball to release it into play". Please note an attempt to kick the ball to continue dribbling (and not releasing it to play) does not meet the exception.
- [No offense. Goalkeeper attempts to kick the ball to release the ball into play. Therefore, they can pick up the ball.](https://youtu.be/pDhRUUha6B0?feature=shared&t=194)

## Circumventing the "backpass" Law

> [It is an indirect free kick offense and caution for unsporting behavior if a player:]
> - initiates a deliberate trick for the ball to be passed (including from a free kick or goal kick) to the goalkeeper with the head, chest, knee etc. to circumvent the Law, whether or not the goalkeeper touches the ball with the hands; the goalkeeper is penalised and cautioned if responsible for initiating the deliberate trick
> - Law 12.2/12.3 Indirect free kick/ Disciplinary Action

Note that initiating the deliberate trick is the offense, whether or not the goalkeeper picks up the ball or attempts to pick up the ball does not matter.
- [A goalkeeper initiates a deliberate trick to be able to handle the ball. The goalkeeper must be cautioned and play is restarted with an indirect free kick.](https://streamable.com/ohy4r)
- [A player initiates a deliberate trick for the goalkeeper to handle the ball. The player must be cautioned and play is restarted with an indirect free kick.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKIOhGtoFLI&t=9s)
