Soccer is the game played without the use of the hand/arms touching the ball except for goalkeepers within their own penalty area and throw-ins.

> A direct free kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offenses:
> - a handball offense (except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area)
> - makes contact with the ball with a held object

## Held object

Any player, including goalkeepers, cannot make contact with the ball with a held object (e.g. shirt, boot, another ball). This is not handball but is a related concept.

[Direct free kick. The player makes contact with the ball by holding their shirt. Generally, a non-mandatory yellow card is given because of how blatant it is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-ZG7VAAvkU)

## Handball by goalkeeper

Note the exception of "except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area".

> The goalkeeper has the same restrictions on handling the ball as any other player outside the penalty area.
> 
> - Law 12.1 Direct free kick

A goalkeeper committing a handball offense outside their own penalty area is just like any other non-goalkeeper player; a direct free kick with the appropriate sanction / disciplinary action is taken. A goalkeeper that directly throws the ball from their own penalty area into the opposing goal is a goal kick for their opponents.

The goalkeeper committing a handball offense in their own penalty area and there are no other offenses is always an indirect free kick (not a penalty kick) and no sanction and no disciplinary action is taken. Read more about goalkeepers including goalkeeper handling offenses in their own penalty area [here](/goalkeeper).

## Hand/arm

The hand/arm excludes the shoulders and the arm pits. The ball can contact the "shirt sleeve" and still be handball.

> For the purposes of determining handball offenses, the upper boundary of the arm is in line with the bottom of the armpit.

## Handling the ball 

> It is an offense if a player:
> - deliberately touches the ball with their hand/arm, for example moving the hand/arm towards the ball
> - touches the ball with their hand/arm when it has made their body unnaturally bigger. A player is considered to have made their body unnaturally bigger when the position of their hand/arm is not a consequence of, or justifiable by, the player’s body movement for that specific situation. By having their hand/arm in such a position, the player takes a risk of their hand/arm being hit by the ball and being penalised
> - scores in the opponents’ goal:
>   - directly from their hand/arm, even if accidental, including by the goalkeeper
>   - immediately after the ball has touched their hand/arm, even if accidental

## Deliberate

[Handball. Moves hand/arm towards ball so its deliberate and makes hands/arm unnaturally bigger.](https://youtu.be/fM_WkMvOogQ?t=29)

## Unnaturally bigger

!> This is my interpretation. There is *a lot* of subjectivity in this.

> Not every touch of a player’s hand/arm with the ball is an offense.

For unnaturally bigger, I emphasize on creating a unfair 2D barrier for the ball to pass from the point the ball was last deliberately played by an opponent. 
- [No handball. The hands/arms are unnaturally bigger - he is deliberately touching the attacker. But, this is not handball as hands/arm was not used as a barrier for the ball to pass himself as the deflection caused the ball to mover laterally rather than forward. Ignore the pundits being sensational.](https://youtu.be/SVhpgEAndsw?feature=shared&t=68)
- [No handball. The hands/arms are unnaturally bigger. But, since the deflection caused the ball to go upwards rather than forward and the ball had not passed the defender, I have no handball.](https://youtu.be/cZWIH6cdTPo?feature=shared&t=346)
- For lower levels of the game, a player's hand/arm may be unnaturally away from the body to protect their face, chest, or torso. But if the ball was going to still hit their head/body then there is no handball as this did not make the 2D barrier for the ball to pass any bigger.

These are clear cut cases of unnaturally bigger or not. Some part of the arm may be unnaturally bigger while other parts are not and are in line with the body and are not making a player bigger - it depensd on which part of the arm is struck by the ball.
- [Handball. The arm/hand is extended away from the body in an unnatural position.](https://youtu.be/vl1DSIjXPnQ?t=180)
- [Handball. The arm/hand is extended away from the body in an unnatural position.](https://youtu.be/RpETARCm7_U?feature=shared&t=70)
- [No handball. The ball hits near the elbow. Not the best angle here. The defender's area between the elbow and shoulder are in line with the body. If the ball hit between the elbow and hand then it would of been handball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9kbNnQWyXU)

SUBJECTIVE: When a defender attempts to block a pass or shot, if there is an unfair barrier with the hands/arm it is handball. Even a natural position that makes a player bigger (e.g. running motion) creates an unfair barrier because the intention of the defender is to move into the path of the pass or shot. The defender takes that risk. To avoid this, players often put their arms behind the back or close to their body/sides. Distance and time to react does not matter.
- [Handball. The hands/arms are in a natural running motion. But, when you deliberately run in to attempt to block a shot/pass and create a barrier for the ball to pass yourself even when hands/arm are in natural position - you take on the risk. I would call that handball.](https://youtu.be/SVhpgEAndsw?feature=shared&t=43)
- [Handball. Does not matter if it hits the hand/arm closer or further away from the ball.](https://youtu.be/UbmKlHk2pgE?feature=shared&t=217)
- [Handball. Although this was at close distance from the last play of the ball, the defender creates an unfair 2D barrier.](https://youtu.be/Y0eWXnECHiw?feature=shared&t=165)
- [Handball. Similar to above. Distance and time to react does not matter.](https://youtu.be/6ipRs3c5WiU?feature=shared&t=151)
<!-- Premier says the above (Leicester City v. Wolves 11/8/2020 is not a handball https://www.premierleague.com/news/2204759 in 1:15 of the video - I totally disagree -->

The ball hitting the hands/arm after a deflection from anyone (including oneself), does not negate creating an unfair 2D barrier from the point the ball was last deliberately played by an opponent as talked about above.
- [Handball. The ball deflects off a defender's foot then touches their arm. Since the ball is behind him/passed him when the ball touches their arm, this created an unfair 2D barrier.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_6hqiU4lqPM)
- [Handball. The ball deflects off a player's foot and would have easily gone past the defender if it weren't for the arms creating an unfair 2D barrier.](https://youtu.be/pDhRUUha6B0?feature=shared&t=167)

When arms are close to the body, there is no handball. After the ball hits an arm, the arm may look farther part then it originally was before the contact. We judge the arm position right before the contact.
- [No handball. The arms are close to the body. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2NYg4tmQa4)

A defender attempting to head the ball but the ball contacts their hands/arm (which are generally in line with the shoulders and away from the body) is not an offense.
- [No handball. The player genuinely tries to header the ball but it contacts their hands/arm.](https://youtu.be/vcgeevnqgwY?feature=shared&t=81)

A defender clearing or saving the ball into their own hand/arm or a team-mate's hand/arm, even if the hand/arm may be considered unnaturally bigger/unfair barrier in other cases, is never handball. 
- [Not handball. The defender is off balance when attempting to clear the ball and his hands/arms.](https://youtu.be/_R9lyEyU5mo?feature=shared&t=460)
- [Not handball. A defender attempting to clear the ball when the ball accidentally hits their hand/arm is never handball.](https://www.tiktok.com/@refsneedlovetoo/video/7261667124119309614)
- [Not handball. The defender is trying to clear the ball and throwing their entire body to attempt to do so.](https://youtu.be/pDhRUUha6B0?feature=shared&t=153)

When a player falls and the hand (and not any other part of arm) is on the ground (or about to be) to support the body, there is never handball. 
- [No handball. The hand is on the ground to support the body after falling.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtMFMXjQCzg)
- [Handball. The arm is on the ground to support the body after falling rather than the hand which creates an unfair 2D barrier.](https://youtu.be/DRCGQXnPBj0?feature=shared&t=227)

## Accidental handball

!> 2021/22 IFAB change. Accidental handball by a team-mate before a goal is scored and accidental handball creating a goal-scoring opportunity have been removed as offenses.

- [Handball. The ball contacts the hand/arm then immediately goes into the goal.](https://youtu.be/_MQpnvxeE9g?t=352)
- [Goal. There was a long time between the ball contacting the hand/arm and the goal.](https://youtu.be/WicGa2_Fw5Q?t=285)

## Foul then handball

When a player believes they have been fouled and goes to ground, they will often commit handball. Since referees punish the first offense to determine restarts, it would be a free kick for the team of the fouled player. If no foul was committed, it is handball. Referees don't like when players do this because it forces referees to make a decision. I would advice against a caution for the blatant handball if no foul is called - there are bigger fish to fry.

[The player is carelessly fouled, falls down, and commits handball. The restart is for the careless foul.](https://youtu.be/xqQqe-LwWXc?t=951)

## Disciplinary Action

If goalkeeper commits a handball offense (as discussed in the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper)) in their own penalty area and there are no other offenses, there is never a sanction/disciplinary sanction even if there was tactical impact. 
- Otherwise, if the handball offense had tactical impact, the proper sanction is talked about in the [tactical impact section](/tactical-impact).

> There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour including if a player:
> - [deliberately] handles the ball in an attempt to score a goal (whether or not the attempt is successful)
> 
> Law 12

- [Messi deliberately touches the ball with the hand/arms to score a goal. The goal should be disallowed and Messi should be shown a caution.](https://youtu.be/fM_WkMvOogQ?t=29)
- [No goal + YC. Player pushes ball into the goal with the hand.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v383WX_Jaxw)
