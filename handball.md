Soccer is the game played without the use of the hand/arms touching the ball except for goalkeepers within their own penalty area and throw-ins.

> A direct free kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offenses:
> - a handball offense (except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area)
> - makes contact with the ball with a held object

## Held object

Any player, including goalkeepers, cannot make contact with the ball with a held object (e.g. shirt, boot, another ball). This is not handball but is a related concept.

- [Direct free kick. The player makes contact with the ball by holding their shirt. Generally, a non-mandatory yellow card is given because of how blatant it is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-ZG7VAAvkU)

## Handball by goalkeeper

Note the exception of "except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area".

> The goalkeeper has the same restrictions on handling the ball as any other player outside the penalty area.
> 
> - Law 12.1 Direct free kick

A goalkeeper committing a handball offense outside their own penalty area is just like any other non-goalkeeper player; a direct free kick with the appropriate sanction / disciplinary action is taken. A goalkeeper that directly throws the ball from their own penalty area into the opposing goal is a goal kick for their opponents.

The goalkeeper committing a handball offense in their own penalty area and there are no other offenses is always an indirect free kick (not a penalty kick) and no sanction and no disciplinary action is taken. Read more about goalkeepers including goalkeeper handling offenses in their own penalty area [here](/goalkeeper).

## Hand/arm

The hand/arm excludes the shoulders and the arm pits. The ball can contact the "shirt sleeve" and still be handball.

> For the purposes of determining handball offenses, the upper boundary of the arm is in line with the bottom of the armpit.

## Handling the ball 

> It is an offense if a player:
> - deliberately touches the ball with their hand/arm, for example moving the hand/arm towards the ball
> - touches the ball with their hand/arm when it has made their body unnaturally bigger. A player is considered to have made their body unnaturally bigger when the position of their hand/arm is not a consequence of, or justifiable by, the player’s body movement for that specific situation. By having their hand/arm in such a position, the player takes a risk of their hand/arm being hit by the ball and being penalised
> - scores in the opponents’ goal:
>   - directly from their hand/arm, even if accidental, including by the goalkeeper
>   - immediately after the ball has touched their hand/arm, even if accidental

## Deliberate

> It is an offense if a player:
> - deliberately touches the ball with their hand/arm, for example moving the hand/arm towards the ball

- [Handball. Deliberately moves hand/arm towards ball - a slight motion counts esspecially on the goalline. [Handball](https://youtu.be/fM_WkMvOogQ?t=29) / [Handball.]](https://youtu.be/X1idfsRcy_w?feature=shared&t=205) / [Handball.](https://youtu.be/oqCT_nKp4Xo?feature=shared&t=6m45s)

## Unnaturally bigger

> It is an offense if a player:
> - touches the ball with their hand/arm when it has made their body unnaturally bigger. A player is considered to have made their body unnaturally bigger when the position of their hand/arm is not a consequence of, or justifiable by, the player’s body movement for that specific situation. By having their hand/arm in such a position, the player takes a risk of their hand/arm being hit by the ball and being penalised

!> This is my interpretation. There is *a lot* of subjectivity in this.

> Not every touch of a player’s hand/arm with the ball is an offense.

When arms are close to the body, there is no handball. After the ball hits an arm, the arm may look farther apart then it originally was before the contact.
- The arm is close to the body and not bigger. [No handball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2NYg4tmQa4)
- The arm is in a "chicken wing" shape [Handball.](https://youtu.be/nSQmRSoMvtw?feature=shared&t=293)

> A player is considered to have made their body unnaturally bigger when the position of their hand/arm is not a consequence of, or justifiable by, the player’s body movement for that specific situation.

Defenders only: When a player falls and the hand (and not any other part of arm) is or about to be on the ground to support the body, this is not handball since the hand/arm position is justifiable for this situation. We do not want player hitting their head on the ground.
- Only the hand is on the ground to support the body after falling. [No handball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtMFMXjQCzg)

Defenders only: A defender attempting to head the ball but the ball contacts their hands/arm (which are generally at shoulder level and away from the body) is not unnaturally bigger.
- The defender is attempting to head the ball. [No handball.](https://youtu.be/vcgeevnqgwY?feature=shared&t=81) / [No handball.](https://youtu.be/RpETARCm7_U?feature=shared&t=70) / [No handball.](https://youtu.be/06lqnmddvKQ?feature=shared&t=840)

Defenders only: Handball is called only if the part of the arm the ball strikes is unnaturally bigger, expected or unexpected
- The struck part is unnaturally bigger.

<!-- Premier says the above (Leicester City v. Wolves 11/8/2020) is not a handball https://youtu.be/6ipRs3c5WiU?feature=shared&t=151 https://www.premierleague.com/news/2204759 in 1:15 of the video - I totally disagree.  -->
- A natural running motion may or may not be considered unnaturally bigger depending on the context. [Subjective call.](https://youtu.be/SVhpgEAndsw?feature=shared&t=43) 
- The struck part is in line with the body. [No handball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9kbNnQWyXU)

Defenders only: The ball hitting the hans/arm after a deflection from anyone (including oneself) does not negate being unnaturally bigger.
- There is minimal benefit from the hand/arm and ball contacting and wheter a player is unnaturally bigger is subjective. [Subjective call.](https://youtu.be/SVhpgEAndsw?feature=shared&t=68) / [Subjective call.](https://youtu.be/cZWIH6cdTPo?feature=shared&t=346)

Defenders only: A defender clearing or deliberately saving the ball into their own hand/arm or a team-mate's hand/arm, even if the hand/arm may be considered unnaturally bigger in other cases, is never handball.
- The defender clears the ball into their own hand/arm. [Not handball.](https://youtu.be/_R9lyEyU5mo?feature=shared&t=460) / [Not handball.](https://www.tiktok.com/@refsneedlovetoo/video/7261667124119309614) / [Not handball.](https://youtu.be/pDhRUUha6B0?feature=shared&t=153)
- The defender clears the ball into their team-mates hand/arm. [Not handball.](https://youtu.be/rN9I23szfx4?feature=shared&t=454)

Attackers only: Attackers have no leeway compared to defenders. It's handball if the attackers hand/arms are bigger (unnaturally or naturally) including after a deflection from anyone (including oneself), attempting to head the ball, or a defender clears or deliberately saves the ball. 
- The attacker's hand/arm is bigger. [Handball.](https://youtu.be/w5QBxc2Hq0o?feature=shared&t=4271) / [Handball.](https://youtu.be/pDhRUUha6B0?feature=shared&t=53)

## Accidental handball

!> 2021/22 IFAB change. Accidental handball by a team-mate before a goal is scored and accidental handball creating a goal-scoring opportunity have been removed as offenses.

> It is an offense if a player:
> - scores in the opponents’ goal:
>   - directly from their hand/arm, even if accidental, including by the goalkeeper
>   - immediately after the ball has touched their hand/arm, even if accidental

Accidental handball is challenging to enforce as the referee will be screened as the attacker will be facing the goal.

- The ball contacts the hand/arm then immediately goes into the goal. [No goal - accidentall handball.](https://youtu.be/_MQpnvxeE9g?t=352)
- The ball contacts the hand/arm but does not immediatl go in the goal.  [Goal - no accidental handball.](https://youtu.be/WicGa2_Fw5Q?t=285)

## Foul then handball

When a player believes they have been fouled and goes to ground, they will often commit handball. Since referees punish the first offense to determine restarts, it would be a free kick for the team of the fouled player. If no foul was committed, it is handball. Referees don't like when players do this because it forces referees to make a decision. I would advice against a caution for the blatant handball if no foul is called - there are bigger fish to fry.

- [The player is carelessly fouled, falls down, and commits handball. The restart is for the careless foul.](https://youtu.be/xqQqe-LwWXc?t=951)

## Disciplinary Action

If goalkeeper commits a handball offense (as discussed in the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper)) in their own penalty area and there are no other offenses, there is never a sanction/disciplinary sanction even if there was tactical impact. 
- Otherwise, if the handball offense had tactical impact, the proper sanction is talked about in the [tactical impact section](/tactical-impact).

> There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour including if a player:
> - [deliberately] handles the ball in an attempt to score a goal (whether or not the attempt is successful)
> 
> Law 12

- [Messi deliberately touches the ball with the hand/arms to score a goal. The goal should be disallowed and Messi should be shown a caution.](https://youtu.be/fM_WkMvOogQ?t=29)
- [No goal + YC. Player pushes ball into the goal with the hand.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v383WX_Jaxw)
