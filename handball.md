Soccer is the game played without the use of the hand/arms except for goalkeepers within their own penalty area and throw-ins.

> A direct free kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offences:
> 
> - a handball offence (except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area)

Note the exception of "except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area".

> The goalkeeper has the same restrictions on handling the ball as any other player outside the penalty area.
> 
> - Law 12.1 Direct free kick

A goalkeeper commiting a handball offense outside their own penalty area is just like any other non-goalkeeper player, a direct free kick with the appropiate sanction / disciplinary action is taken.

The goalkeeper commiting a handball offense in their own penalty area and there are no other offenses is always an indirect free kick (not a penalty kick) and no sanction and no disciplinary action is taken. Read more about goalkeepers including goalkeeper handling offenses in their own penalty area [here](/goalkeeper).

Handball causes a lot of debate as it is often times subjective and The IFAB has been changing the definition of handball frequently (they are trying their best). They offer this guidance for us:

> ### Handling the ball
> 
> For the purposes of determining handball offences, the upper boundary of the arm is in line with the bottom of the armpit. Not every touch of a player’s hand/arm with the ball is an offence.
> 
> It is an offence if a player:
> 
> - deliberately touches the ball with their hand/arm, for example moving the hand/arm towards the ball
> 
> - touches the ball with their hand/arm when it has made their body unnaturally bigger. A player is considered to have made their body unnaturally bigger when the position of their hand/arm is not a consequence of, or justifiable by, the player’s body movement for that specific situation. By having their hand/arm in such a position, the player takes a risk of their hand/arm being hit by the ball and being penalised
> 
> - scores in the opponents’ goal:
>   
>   - directly from their hand/arm, even if accidental, including by the goalkeeper
>   
>   - immediately after the ball has touched their hand/arm, even if accidental

## Disciplinary Action

If the offense had tactical impact, the proper sanction is talked about in [tactical impact section](/tactical-impact).

> There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour including if a player:
> 
> - shows a lack of respect for the game
> - persistent offenses
> - handles the ball in an attempt to score a goal (whether or not the attempt is successful)
> 
> Law 12

Blatant and fully intentional handball offenses, even when there is minimal tactical impact, may be considered as "showing a lack of respect of the game".
