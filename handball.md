Soccer is the game played without the use of the hand/arms touching the ball except for goalkeepers within their own penalty area and throw-ins.

> A direct free kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offenses:
> - a handball offense (except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area)
> - makes contact with the ball with a held object

## Held object

Any player, including goalkeepers, cannot make contact with the ball with a held object (e.g. shirt, boot, another ball). This is not handball but is a related concept.

- [Direct free kick. The player makes contact with the ball by holding their shirt.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-ZG7VAAvkU)

## Handball by goalkeeper

Note the exception of "except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area".

> The goalkeeper has the same restrictions on handling the ball as any other player outside the penalty area.
> 
> - Law 12.1 Direct free kick

A goalkeeper committing a handball offense outside their own penalty area is just like any other non-goalkeeper player; a direct free kick with the appropriate sanction / disciplinary action is taken. A goalkeeper that directly throws the ball from their own penalty area into the opposing goal is a goal kick for their opponents.

The goalkeeper committing a handball offense in their own penalty area and there are no other offenses is always an indirect free kick (not a penalty kick) and no sanction and no disciplinary action is taken. Read more about goalkeepers including goalkeeper handling offenses in their own penalty area [here](/goalkeeper).

## Handling the ball

The hand/arm excludes the shoulders and the arm pits. The ball can contact the "shirt sleeve" and still be handball.

> For the purposes of determining handball offenses, the upper boundary of the arm is in line with the bottom of the armpit.

When a player believes they have been fouled and goes to ground, they will often commit handball. Since referees punish the first offense to determine restarts, it would be a free kick for the team of the fouled player. If no foul was committed, it is handball. Referees don't like when players do this because it forces them to make a decision.

> It is an offense if a player:
> - deliberately touches the ball with their hand/arm, for example moving the hand/arm towards the ball
> - touches the ball with their hand/arm when it has made their body unnaturally bigger. A player is considered to have made their body unnaturally bigger when the position of their hand/arm is not a consequence of, or justifiable by, the player’s body movement for that specific situation. By having their hand/arm in such a position, the player takes a risk of their hand/arm being hit by the ball and being penalised
> - scores in the opponents’ goal:
>   - directly from their hand/arm, even if accidental, including by the goalkeeper
>   - immediately after the ball has touched their hand/arm, even if accidental

## Deliberate

> It is an offense if a player:
> - deliberately touches the ball with their hand/arm, for example moving the hand/arm towards the ball

- A slight motion (even inward towards the body) is enough for deliberate handball. [Handball](https://youtu.be/fM_WkMvOogQ?t=29) / [Handball.](https://youtu.be/X1idfsRcy_w?feature=shared&t=205) / [Handball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLUxMRYJAso&ab_channel=SeanNicko)


## Unnaturally bigger

> It is an offense if a player:
> - touches the ball with their hand/arm when it has made their body unnaturally bigger. A player is considered to have made their body unnaturally bigger when the position of their hand/arm is not a consequence of, or justifiable by, the player’s body movement for that specific situation. By having their hand/arm in such a position, the player takes a risk of their hand/arm being hit by the ball and being penalised

!> This is my interpretation that also considers the "spirit of the Law". There is *a lot* of subjectivity in this.

> Not every touch of a player’s hand/arm with the ball is an offense.

When the arm is close to the body, it is not unnaturally bigger. After the ball hits an arm, the arm may look farther apart then it originally was before the contact.
- The arm is close to the body and not bigger. [No handball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2NYg4tmQa4) / [No handball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9kbNnQWyXU)

> A player is considered to have made their body unnaturally bigger when the position of their hand/arm is not a consequence of, or justifiable by, the player’s body movement for that specific situation.

I make the distinction for identyifing the hand/arm as unnaturally bigger for these situations:
- no forgivness category
  - a attacker or
  - neutral situation / no team clearly in possession (e.g. ball bouncing) or
  - defender in their attacking half or
  - defender handball leads to a promising attack or
  - defender on/near the goal line
- forgivness category
  - a defender in their defensive half and defender handball does not lead to a promising attack

No forgivness category: There is no leeway in these situations. It's handball if the player's hand/arm is bigger (by not being completely against the body) and touches the ball (unnaturally or naturally) including after a deflection from anyone (including oneself), attempting to head the ball, or a defender clears or deliberately saves the ball. The amount of bigness of the hand/arms allowed is none due to its advantage it causes. 
- The attacker's hand/arm makes contact with the ball. [Handball.](https://youtu.be/w5QBxc2Hq0o?feature=shared&t=4271) / [Handball.](https://youtu.be/pDhRUUha6B0?feature=shared&t=53) / [Handball.](https://youtu.be/GMQQqGXx8mg?feature=shared&t=54)
- [Defender in their attacking half](https://youtu.be/PlFDQiy5TOg?feature=shared&t=128)
- A defender on or near the goal line, if the hand/arm is the first contact of the ball, it should be considered handball unless the arm is completely with the body. This includes a defender attempting to head the ball.  [Handball.](https://youtu.be/oqCT_nKp4Xo?feature=shared&t=6m45s) [Handball.](https://youtu.be/bg3psAYfOv8?feature=shared)

Forgivness category: When a defender falls and the hand (and not any other part of arm) is or about to be on the ground to support the body, this is not unnaturally bigger since the hand/arm position is justifiable for this situation. We do not want player hitting their head on the ground.
- Only the defender's hand is on the ground to support the body after falling. [No handball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtMFMXjQCzg) / [No handball.](https://youtu.be/vX6ew_5DKug?feature=shared&t=173)
- The entire arm is on the ground to support the body after falling. [Handball.](https://youtu.be/DRCGQXnPBj0?feature=shared&t=227)

Forgivness category: A defender attempting to or is near a player attempting to head the ball is not unnaturally bigger unless their arms are above their shoulders or the shot is taken on goal.
- The defender is near a player attempting to head the ball. [No handball.](https://youtu.be/X_fcQ2-OTPE?feature=shared&t=3) / [Not Handball.](https://youtu.be/RpETARCm7_U?feature=shared&t=70) / [Not Handball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4a3ibwKnoM)
- Shot on goal. [Handball](https://youtu.be/OfekZUATrwY?feature=shared&t=65)
- The defender is attempting to head the ball. [Not handball](https://youtu.be/vmis513lhSY?feature=shared&t=230)
- Remember an attacker gets no special exceptions if the hand/arm is bigger. [Handball.](https://youtu.be/06lqnmddvKQ?feature=shared&t=840)

Forgivness category: The ball hitting the hands/arm after a deflection from a different player does not negate a defender being unnaturally bigger and stopping the ball from going past them. The ball hitting the hands/arm after a deflection from themself is okay if they get signficant contact before hitting the arm/hand.
- The ball would not have gone past the defender if no hand/arm touch. [No handball.](https://youtu.be/SVhpgEAndsw?feature=shared&t=68) / 
- The ball would have passed the defender if the hand/arm had not interfered. [Handball.](https://youtu.be/rN9I23szfx4?feature=shared&t=421) / [Handball.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_6hqiU4lqPM)
- Signicant touch before handball from self [No handball.](https://youtu.be/cZWIH6cdTPo?feature=shared&t=346) / [No handball](https://youtu.be/pmcs39I2j1k?feature=shared&t=663)

Forgivness category: A defender deliberately clearing or deliberately saving the ball into their own hand/arm in any case or into a team-mate's hand/arm only when the ball is played away from the goal is not unnaturally bigger (even when their arms are above their head or away from the body). 
- Not handball. The defender deliberately clears the ball into their own hand/arm. [Example 1.](https://youtu.be/_R9lyEyU5mo?feature=shared&t=460) / [Example 2.](https://www.tiktok.com/@refsneedlovetoo/video/7261667124119309614) / [Example 3.](https://youtu.be/pDhRUUha6B0?feature=shared&t=153) / [Example 4 - Deliberate play but slipped](https://youtu.be/pDhRUUha6B0?feature=shared&t=167)
- Not handball. The defender deliberately clears the ball into their team-mates hand/arm and the ball is played away from goal. [Example 1.](https://youtu.be/rN9I23szfx4?feature=shared&t=454) / [Example 2](https://youtu.be/h_M-c9ZeJ8g?feature=shared&t=68) / [Exampe 3](https://youtu.be/NYLM7umIYDE?feature=shared&t=530)

## Accidental handball

> It is an offense if a player:
> - scores in the opponents’ goal:
>   - directly from their hand/arm, even if accidental, including by the goalkeeper
>   - immediately after the ball has touched their hand/arm, even if accidental

Accidental handball is challenging to enforce as the referee will be screened as the attacker will be facing the goal.

- No goal. The ball contacts the hand/arm then immediately goes into the goal. [Example 1](https://youtu.be/_MQpnvxeE9g?t=352)
- Ignoring that this is handball for being unnaturally bigger, the time period before the hand/arm and ball contact and the goal is not immediate. [Example 1](https://youtu.be/WicGa2_Fw5Q?t=285)


## Disciplinary Action

If goalkeeper commits a handball offense (as discussed in the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper)) in their own penalty area and there are no other offenses, there is never a sanction/disciplinary sanction even if there was tactical impact. 
- Otherwise, if the handball offense had tactical impact, the proper sanction is talked about in the [tactical impact section](/tactical-impact).

> There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour including if a player:
> - handles the ball in an attempt to score a goal (whether or not the attempt is successful)
> 
> Law 12

- No goal + YC. [Example 1](https://youtu.be/fM_WkMvOogQ?t=29), [Example 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v383WX_Jaxw), [Compilation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapthEt3_PA&ab_channel=FootballGoals)
