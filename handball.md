Soccer is the game played without the use of the hand/arms touching the ball except for goalkeepers within their own penalty area and throw-ins.

> A direct free kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offences:
> - a handball offence (except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area)
> - makes contact with the ball with a held object

## Held object

Any player, including goalkeepers, cannot make contact with the ball with a held object (e.g. shirt, boot, another ball). This is separate from the handball rule but is realated.

[The player makes contact with the ball with holding their shirt. Direct free kick.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-ZG7VAAvkU)

## Handball by goalkeeper

Note the exception of "except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area".

> The goalkeeper has the same restrictions on handling the ball as any other player outside the penalty area.
> 
> - Law 12.1 Direct free kick

A goalkeeper commiting a handball offense outside their own penalty area is just like any other non-goalkeeper player, a direct free kick with the appropiate sanction / disciplinary action is taken. A goalkeeper that directly throws the ball from their own penalty area into the opposing goal is a goalkick for their opponents.

The goalkeeper commiting a handball offense in their own penalty area and there are no other offenses is always an indirect free kick (not a penalty kick) and no sanction and no disciplinary action is taken. Read more about goalkeepers including goalkeeper handling offenses in their own penalty area [here](/goalkeeper).

## Hand/arm

The hand/arm excludes the shoulders and the arm pits.

> For the purposes of determining handball offences, the upper boundary of the arm is in line with the bottom of the armpit.

## Handling the ball 

> It is an offence if a player:
> - deliberately touches the ball with their hand/arm, for example moving the hand/arm towards the ball
> - touches the ball with their hand/arm when it has made their body unnaturally bigger. A player is considered to have made their body unnaturally bigger when the position of their hand/arm is not a consequence of, or justifiable by, the player’s body movement for that specific situation. By having their hand/arm in such a position, the player takes a risk of their hand/arm being hit by the ball and being penalised
> - scores in the opponents’ goal:
>   - directly from their hand/arm, even if accidental, including by the goalkeeper
>   - immediately after the ball has touched their hand/arm, even if accidental

## Deliberate

[Handball. Moves hand/arm towards ball so its deliberate and makes hands/arm unnaturally bigger.](https://youtu.be/fM_WkMvOogQ?t=29)

## Unnaturally bigger

!> This is my interpretation. There is *a lot* of subjectivity in this.

> Not every touch of a player’s hand/arm with the ball is an offence.

For unnaturally bigger, I emphasize on creating a unfair 2D barrier for the ball to pass from the point the ball was last deliberately played.
- [No handball. The hands/arms are unnaturally bigger - he is deliberatlly touching the attacker. But, this is not handball as hands/arm was not used as a barrier for the ball to pass the himself as the deflection caused the ball to mover laterally rather than forward. Ignore the pundits being sensational.](https://youtu.be/SVhpgEAndsw?feature=shared&t=68)
- For lower levels of the game, a player's hand/arm may be unnaturally away from the body to protect their face, chest, or torso. But, if the ball was going to still hit their head/body then there is no handball as this not make the 2D barrier for the ball to pass any biggger.

While a defender attempting to block a pass/shot, the defender creates an unfair barrier with the hands/arm. Even a natural position (e.g. running motion) creates an unfair barrier because the intention of the defender is to move into the path of the pass/shot and the defender takes that risk. To avoid this, players often put their arms behind the back or close to their body/sides.
- [Handball. The arm/hand is extended away from the body that is not natural.](https://youtu.be/vl1DSIjXPnQ?t=180)
- [Handball. The arm/hand is extended away from the body that is not natural.](https://youtu.be/RpETARCm7_U?feature=shared&t=70)
- [Handball. The hands/arms are in a natural running motion. But, when you deliberately run in to attempt to block a shot/pass and create a barrier for the ball to pass yourself even when hands/arm are in natural position - you take on the risk. I would call that handball.](https://youtu.be/SVhpgEAndsw?feature=shared&t=43)
- [No handball. The ball hits near the elbow. Not the best angle here. The defender's area between the elbow and shoulder are in line with the body. If the ball hit between the elbow and hand then it would of been handball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9kbNnQWyXU)

2021/22 IFAB CHANGE: The ball hitting the hands/arm after a deflection from anyone (including oneself), does not negate creating an unfair 2D barrier from the point the ball was last deliberately played talked about above.
- [Handball. The ball deflects off a players foot and creates the unfair 2D barrier.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_6hqiU4lqPM)
- [Handball. The ball deflects off a player foot and contacts the unfair 2D barrier.](https://youtu.be/pDhRUUha6B0?feature=shared&t=167)

When arms are close to the body, there is no handball. After the ball its an arm, the arm may look farther part then it originally was before the contact. We judge the arm position right before the contact.
- [No handball. The arms are close to the body. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2NYg4tmQa4)

I know this contradicts the above but a defender attempting to head the ball but the ball contacts their hands/arm which are generally in line with the shoulders and away from the body is not an offense.
- [No handball. The player genunily tries to get the header but it contacts their hands/arm.](https://youtu.be/vcgeevnqgwY?feature=shared&t=81)

A defender deliberately clearing the ball then the ball accidently hits their hand/arm, even if it may be considered unnaturally bigger/unfair barrier in other cases, is never handball. 
- [Not handball. The defender is off balance when attempting to clear the ball and his hands/arms are in a justifable position.](https://youtu.be/_R9lyEyU5mo?feature=shared&t=460)
- [Not handball. A defender attempting to clear the ball when the ball accidently hits their hand/arm is never handball.](https://www.tiktok.com/@refsneedlovetoo/video/7261667124119309614)
- [Not handball. The defender is trying to clear the ball and throwing their entire body to attempt to do so.](https://youtu.be/pDhRUUha6B0?feature=shared&t=153)

When a player falls and the hand/arm that makes contacts the ball is between the body and the ground to support the body, there is never handball

## Accidental handball

!> 2021/22 IFAB change. Accidental handball by a team-mate before a goal is scored and accidental handball creating a goal-scoring opportunity have been removed as offences.

[Handball. The ball contacts the hand/arm then immediatly goes into the goal.](https://youtu.be/_MQpnvxeE9g?t=352)

[Goal. There was a long time between the ball contacting the hand/arm and the goal.](https://youtu.be/WicGa2_Fw5Q?t=285)

## Foul then handball

When a player believes they have been fouled and goes to ground, they will often commit handball. Since referees punish the first offense to determine restarts, it would be a free kick for the team of the foul player. If no foul was commited, it is handball. Referees don't like when players do this becuase it force referees to make a decision. I would advice against a caution for the blatant handball if no foul is called- there are bigger fish to fry.

[The player is carelessly fouled, falls down, and commits handball. The restart is for the careless foul.](https://youtu.be/xqQqe-LwWXc?t=951)

## Disciplinary Action

If goalkeeper commits a handball offense (as discussed in the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper)) in their own penalty area and there are no other offenses, there is never a sanction/disciplinary sanction even if there was tactical impact. 

If the handball offense had tactical impact, the proper sanction is talked about in the [tactical impact section](/tactical-impact).

> There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour including if a player:
> - handles the ball in an attempt to score a goal (whether or not the attempt is successful)
> 
> Law 12

[Messi deliberately touches the ball with the hand/arms to score a goal. The goal should be disallowed and Messi should be shown a caution.](https://youtu.be/fM_WkMvOogQ?t=29)
