Soccer is the game played without the use of the hand/arms touching the ball except for goalkeepers within their own penalty area and throw-ins.

> A direct free kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offenses:
> - a handball offense (except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area)
> - makes contact with the ball with a held object

## Held object

Any player, including goalkeepers, cannot make contact with the ball with a held object (e.g. shirt, boot, another ball). This is not handball but is a related concept.

[Direct free kick. The player makes contact with the ball by holding their shirt. Generally, a non-mandatory yellow card is given because of how blatant it is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-ZG7VAAvkU)

## Handball by goalkeeper

Note the exception of "except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area".

> The goalkeeper has the same restrictions on handling the ball as any other player outside the penalty area.
> 
> - Law 12.1 Direct free kick

A goalkeeper committing a handball offense outside their own penalty area is just like any other non-goalkeeper player; a direct free kick with the appropriate sanction / disciplinary action is taken. A goalkeeper that directly throws the ball from their own penalty area into the opposing goal is a goal kick for their opponents.

The goalkeeper committing a handball offense in their own penalty area and there are no other offenses is always an indirect free kick (not a penalty kick) and no sanction and no disciplinary action is taken. Read more about goalkeepers including goalkeeper handling offenses in their own penalty area [here](/goalkeeper).

## Hand/arm

The hand/arm excludes the shoulders and the arm pits. The ball can contact the "shirt sleeve" and still be handball.

> For the purposes of determining handball offenses, the upper boundary of the arm is in line with the bottom of the armpit.

## Handling the ball 

> It is an offense if a player:
> - deliberately touches the ball with their hand/arm, for example moving the hand/arm towards the ball
> - touches the ball with their hand/arm when it has made their body unnaturally bigger. A player is considered to have made their body unnaturally bigger when the position of their hand/arm is not a consequence of, or justifiable by, the player’s body movement for that specific situation. By having their hand/arm in such a position, the player takes a risk of their hand/arm being hit by the ball and being penalised
> - scores in the opponents’ goal:
>   - directly from their hand/arm, even if accidental, including by the goalkeeper
>   - immediately after the ball has touched their hand/arm, even if accidental

## Deliberate

- [Handball. Moves hand/arm towards ball so its deliberate and makes hands/arm unnaturally bigger.](https://youtu.be/fM_WkMvOogQ?t=29)
- [Handball. Moves hand/arm towards ball - a slight motion still counts.](https://youtu.be/X1idfsRcy_w?feature=shared&t=205)

## Unnaturally bigger

!> This is my interpretation. There is *a lot* of subjectivity in this.

> Not every touch of a player’s hand/arm with the ball is an offense.

When arms are close to the body, there is no handball. After the ball hits an arm, the arm may look farther part then it originally was before the contact. We judge the arm position right before the contact.
- [No handball. The arms are close to the body. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2NYg4tmQa4)

When a player falls and the hand (and not any other part of arm) is or about to be on the ground to support the body, there is never handball. 
- [No handball. The hand is on the ground to support the body after falling.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtMFMXjQCzg)
- [Handball. The arm is on the ground to support the body after falling rather than just the hand which creates an unfair 2D barrier.](https://youtu.be/DRCGQXnPBj0?feature=shared&t=227)

These are clear cut cases of unnaturally bigger or not. Some part of the arm may be unnaturally bigger while other parts are not and are in line with the body and are not making a player bigger - it depends on which part of the arm is struck by the ball.
- [Handball.](https://youtu.be/vl1DSIjXPnQ?t=180)
- [Handball. Holding a team-mate on the wall means the arm is unnaturally bigger.](https://youtu.be/rN9I23szfx4?feature=shared&t=382)
- [No handball. The ball hits near the elbow. Not the best angle here. The defender's area between the elbow and shoulder are in line with the body. If the ball hit between the elbow and hand which are not line with the body then it would of been handball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9kbNnQWyXU)

Defenders only: For unnaturally bigger, I emphasize defenders creating a unfair 2D barrier for the ball to pass from the point the ball was last deliberately played by an opponent. 

Defenders only: The ball hitting the hands/arm after a deflection from anyone (including oneself), does not negate creating an unfair 2D barrier from the point the ball was last deliberately played by an opponent.
- [No handball. The hands/arms are unnaturally bigger - the defender is deliberately touching the attacker. But, this is not handball as hands/arm was not used as a barrier for the ball to pass himself as the deflection caused the ball to mover laterally rather than forward. Ignore the pundits being sensational.](https://youtu.be/SVhpgEAndsw?feature=shared&t=68)
- [No handball. The deflection off the defender causes the ball to move upwards rather than past him so there is no unfair 2D barrier. ](https://youtu.be/cZWIH6cdTPo?feature=shared&t=346)
- [Handball. The ball deflects off a team-mate but continues forward and touches the defender arm which created an unfair 2D barrier.](https://youtu.be/rN9I23szfx4?feature=shared&t=421)
- [Handball. The ball deflects off a defender's foot then touches their arm. Since the ball is behind him/passed him when the ball touches their arm, this created an unfair 2D barrier.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_6hqiU4lqPM)
- [Handball. The ball deflects off a defender's foot and would have easily gone past the defender if it weren't for the arms creating an unfair 2D barrier.](https://youtu.be/pDhRUUha6B0?feature=shared&t=167)
- For lower levels of the game, a player's hand/arm may be unnaturally away from the body to protect their face, chest, or torso. But if the ball was going to still hit their head/body then there is no handball as this did not make the 2D barrier for the ball to pass any bigger.

Distance and time to react do not matter. It does not matter if the ball hits the hand/arm closer or further away from the ball.
- [Handball. Although this was at close distance from the last play of the ball, the defender creates an unfair 2D barrier.](https://youtu.be/Y0eWXnECHiw?feature=shared&t=165)
- [Handball. Does not matter if it hits the hand/arm closer or further away from the ball.](https://youtu.be/UbmKlHk2pgE?feature=shared&t=217)
- [Handball. Similar to above. Distance and time to react does not matter.](https://youtu.be/6ipRs3c5WiU?feature=shared&t=151)
<!-- Premier says the above (Leicester City v. Wolves 11/8/2020 is not a handball https://youtu.be/6ipRs3c5WiU?feature=shared&t=151 https://www.premierleague.com/news/2204759 in 1:15 of the video - I totally disagree. What are they smoking? -->

Defenders only & VERY SUBJECTIVE: When a defender attempts to block a pass or shot, a natural running motion is an unfair 2D barrier. The defender takes that risk. To avoid this, players often put their arms behind the back or close to their body/sides. 
- [Handball. The defender creates an unfair 2D barrier even if its considered a natural running motion.](https://youtu.be/SVhpgEAndsw?feature=shared&t=43) 
- [Handball. The defender creates an unfair 2D barrier even if its considered a natural running motion.](https://youtu.be/rN9I23szfx4?feature=shared&t=303)<!-- Instant Replay and Video Review disagrees say no handball. https://youtu.be/rN9I23szfx4?feature=shared&t=303 -->

Defenders only: A defender attempting to head the ball but the ball contacts their hands/arm (which are generally at  shoulder level and away from the body) is not an offense.
- [No handball. The defender genuinely tries to header the ball but it contacts their hands/arm.](https://youtu.be/vcgeevnqgwY?feature=shared&t=81)
- [Handball? The defender is attempting to header the ball. I really don't know. I need to think about this. If the above is not handball in the highest level of the game, then how can you call this handball. ](https://youtu.be/RpETARCm7_U?feature=shared&t=70)

A player deliberately playing the ball into their own hand/arm or a defender deliberately plays the ball (like when clearing or saving it) into a team-mate's hand/arm, even if the hand/arm may be considered unnaturally bigger/unfair 2D barrier in other cases, is never handball. 
- [Not handball. The defender clears the ball into his hands/arms.](https://youtu.be/_R9lyEyU5mo?feature=shared&t=460)
- [Not handball. The defender clears the ball into his hands/arms.](https://www.tiktok.com/@refsneedlovetoo/video/7261667124119309614)
- [Not handball. The defender clears the ball into his hands/arms.](https://youtu.be/pDhRUUha6B0?feature=shared&t=153)
- [Not handball. The defender clears the ball into their team-mates arms.](https://youtu.be/rN9I23szfx4?feature=shared&t=454)

Attackers only: Attackers have no leeway compared to defenders and don't follow the unfair 2D barrier standard. Unless the player deliberately plays the ball into their own hand/arm, it's handball if the attackers hand/arms are bigger (unnaturally or naturally) including after a deflection from anyone (including oneself), attempting to head the ball, or a defender clears or deliberately saves the ball.
- [Handball. The ball deflects from the attacker's foot and hits his arm that are unnaturally bigger. If he was a defender, there is no handball since the ball moved laterally rather than forward after the deflection.](https://youtu.be/w5QBxc2Hq0o?feature=shared&t=4271)
- [Handball. The defender attempts to clear the ball but it strikes the attacker's arm which are bigger.](https://youtu.be/pDhRUUha6B0?feature=shared&t=53)
## Accidental handball

!> 2021/22 IFAB change. Accidental handball by a team-mate before a goal is scored and accidental handball creating a goal-scoring opportunity have been removed as offenses.

Accidental handball is challenging to enforce as the referee will be screened as the attacker will be facing the goal.

- [Handball. The ball contacts the hand/arm then immediately goes into the goal.](https://youtu.be/_MQpnvxeE9g?t=352)
- [Goal. There was a long time between the ball contacting the hand/arm and the goal.](https://youtu.be/WicGa2_Fw5Q?t=285)

## Foul then handball

When a player believes they have been fouled and goes to ground, they will often commit handball. Since referees punish the first offense to determine restarts, it would be a free kick for the team of the fouled player. If no foul was committed, it is handball. Referees don't like when players do this because it forces referees to make a decision. I would advice against a caution for the blatant handball if no foul is called - there are bigger fish to fry.

[The player is carelessly fouled, falls down, and commits handball. The restart is for the careless foul.](https://youtu.be/xqQqe-LwWXc?t=951)

## Disciplinary Action

If goalkeeper commits a handball offense (as discussed in the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper)) in their own penalty area and there are no other offenses, there is never a sanction/disciplinary sanction even if there was tactical impact. 
- Otherwise, if the handball offense had tactical impact, the proper sanction is talked about in the [tactical impact section](/tactical-impact).

> There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour including if a player:
> - [deliberately] handles the ball in an attempt to score a goal (whether or not the attempt is successful)
> 
> Law 12

- [Messi deliberately touches the ball with the hand/arms to score a goal. The goal should be disallowed and Messi should be shown a caution.](https://youtu.be/fM_WkMvOogQ?t=29)
- [No goal + YC. Player pushes ball into the goal with the hand.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v383WX_Jaxw)
