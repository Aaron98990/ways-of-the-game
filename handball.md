Soccer is the game played without the use of the hand/arms touching the ball except for goalkeepers within their own penalty area and throw-ins.

Any player, including goalkeepers, cannot make contact with the ball with a held object (e.g. shirt, boot, another ball). This is separate from the handball rule but is realated.

> A direct free kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offences:
> - a handball offence (except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area)
> - makes contact with the ball with a held object

Note the exception of "except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area".

> The goalkeeper has the same restrictions on handling the ball as any other player outside the penalty area.
> 
> - Law 12.1 Direct free kick

A goalkeeper commiting a handball offense outside their own penalty area is just like any other non-goalkeeper player, a direct free kick with the appropiate sanction / disciplinary action is taken.

The goalkeeper commiting a handball offense in their own penalty area and there are no other offenses is always an indirect free kick (not a penalty kick) and no sanction and no disciplinary action is taken. Read more about goalkeepers including goalkeeper handling offenses in their own penalty area [here](/goalkeeper).

## Hand/arm

The hand/arm excludes the shoulders and the arm pits.

> For the purposes of determining handball offences, the upper boundary of the arm is in line with the bottom of the armpit.

## Handling the ball 
Handball is subjective and bas been defined differently over the years.

> It is an offence if a player:
> - deliberately touches the ball with their hand/arm, for example moving the hand/arm towards the ball
> - touches the ball with their hand/arm when it has made their body unnaturally bigger. A player is considered to have made their body unnaturally bigger when the position of their hand/arm is not a consequence of, or justifiable by, the player’s body movement for that specific situation. By having their hand/arm in such a position, the player takes a risk of their hand/arm being hit by the ball and being penalised
> - scores in the opponents’ goal:
>   - directly from their hand/arm, even if accidental, including by the goalkeeper
>   - immediately after the ball has touched their hand/arm, even if accidental

## Deliberate

[Handball. Moves hand/arm towards ball so its deliberate and makes hands/arm unnaturally bigger.](https://youtu.be/fM_WkMvOogQ?t=29)

## Unnaturally bigger

> Not every touch of a player’s hand/arm with the ball is an offence.

A defender attempting to clear the ball when the ball accidently hits their hand/arm is never handball.
- [Not handball. The defender is off balance when attempting to clear the ball and his hands/arms are in a justifable position.](https://youtu.be/_R9lyEyU5mo?feature=shared&t=460)
- [Not handball. A defender attempting to clear the ball when the ball accidently hits their hand/arm is never handball.](https://www.tiktok.com/@refsneedlovetoo/video/7261667124119309614)

The ball hitting the hands/arm after a deflection from anyone (including oneself), does not negate the hands/arm being unnaturally bigger.
- [The ball deflects off a players foot and contatacts the hands/arm in an unnatural position.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_6hqiU4lqPM)

But, emphasis on unnaturally bigger should be on creating a barrier for the ball to pass the defender - not that the hands/arms are unnaturally away from the body.
- [The hands/arms are unnaturally bigger - he is deliberatlly touching the attacker. But, not handball as hands/arm was not used as a barrier for the ball to pass the defender. Ignore the pundits being sensational.](https://youtu.be/SVhpgEAndsw?feature=shared&t=68)
- A player's hand/arm may be unnaturally away from the body to protect their face, chest, or torso. But, if the ball was going to still hit their head/body then there is no handball as this not make the barrier for the ball to pass any biggger.


## Accidental handball

[Handball. The ball contacts the hand/arm then immediatly goes into the goal.](https://youtu.be/_MQpnvxeE9g?t=352)

[Goal. There was a long time between the ball contacting the hand/arm and the goal.](https://youtu.be/WicGa2_Fw5Q?t=285)

## Foul then handball

When a player believes they have been fouled and goes to ground, they will often commit handball. Since referees punish the first offense to determine restarts, it would be a free kick for the team of the foul player. If no foul was commited, it is handball. Referees don't like when players do this becuase it force referees to make a decision. I would advice against a caution for the blatant handball if no foul is called- there are bigger fish to fry.

[The player is carelessly fouled, falls down, and commits handball. The restart is for the careless foul.](https://youtu.be/xqQqe-LwWXc?t=951)

## Disciplinary Action

If goalkeeper commits a handball offense (as discussed in the [goalkeeper section](/goalkeeper)) in their own penalty area and there are no other offenses, there is never a sanction/disciplinary sanction even if there was tactical impact. 

If the handball offense had tactical impact, the proper sanction is talked about in the [tactical impact section](/tactical-impact).

> There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour including if a player:
> - handles the ball in an attempt to score a goal (whether or not the attempt is successful)
> 
> Law 12
