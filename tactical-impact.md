Whenever an offense occurs, the referee must judge its tactical impact. There are three levels of tactical impact:
- Minimal/None
- Stopping a Promising Attack (SPA)
- Denial of an Obvious Goal Scoring Opportunity (DOGSO)

The level of tactical impact does not depend on intention. A player can unintentionally and not deliberately stop a promising attack or deny an obvious goal scoring opportunity but that does not change the referee's sanction.

Many people will call SPA or DOGSO tactical fouls. Many SPA and DOGSO offenses are tactical fouls but not all. A tactical foul is committed when a player deliberately fouls another but as said above intention/being deliberate does not matter. 

Stopping a Promising Attack is not defned in the Laws of the Game but generally commiting a foul with the main purpose to stop a player from advancing would qualify. 

## DOGSO

Deny an obvious goal scoring opportunity is punished with a yellow card or red card depending on the situation.

> ### Denying a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity (DOGSO)
> 
> Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball; in all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling, pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.), the offending player must be sent off.
> 
> Where a player denies the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by a handball offence, the player is sent off wherever the offence occurs (except a goalkeeper within their penalty area).

The Laws of the Game give us some guidance on what is DOGSO.

> The following must be considered:
> 
> - distance between the offence and the goal
> 
> - general direction of the play
> 
> - likelihood of keeping or gaining control of the ball
> 
> - location and number of defenders
> 
> Law 12.3 Direct Free Kick

Generally, referees require that all four considerations to be required for DOGSO to be met but it is not a requirement. 

## Disciplinary Action

> There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour including if a player:
> 
> - handles the ball to interfere with or stop a promising attack
> 
> - commits any other offence which interferes with or stops a promising attack, except where the referee awards a penalty kick for an offence which was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball
> 
> - denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by committing an offence which was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball and the referee awards a penalty kick
> 
> Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

> A player, substitute or substituted player who commits any of the following offences is sent off:
> 
> - denying the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by a handball offence (except a goalkeeper within their penalty area)
> 
> - denying a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity to an opponent whose overall movement is towards the offender’s goal by an offence punishable by a free kick
> 
> Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

[PRO Referees have a great example with 9 video examples comparing SPA vs DOGSO](https://proreferees.com/2020/04/03/pro-insight-tactical-fouling-in-soccer-what-officials-look-for/)

Please note that DOGSO applies to "an offense punishable by a free kick". This means that indirect free kick offenses and direct free kick offenses can lead to a red card for DOGSO.

[The referee should of had the goalkick retaken as the goalkeeper was just setting the ball. Ignoring that, the goalkeeper plays the goalkick twice denying the opponent a clear goal scoring opportunity. Although, the restart is an indrect free kick the offendor is sent off.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uivLc9urdBY)

## If Advantage is played

> If the referee plays the advantage for an offence for which a caution/sending-off would have been issued had play been stopped, this caution/sending-off must be issued when the ball is next out of play. However, if the offence was denying the opposing team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity the player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour; if the offence was interfering with or stopping a promising attack, the player is not cautioned.
> 
> - Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

This does not stop the referee from penalizing a more serious offense that occurs at the same time. If a player SPA in the penalty area which was an attempt for the ball (no card) and commits:
- reckless foul. The referee would still show a yellow card for the reckless foul.
- lack of respect of the game - (e.g. blatant holding). The referee would still show a yellow card for lack of respect of the game.
- persistent offenses. The referee would still show a yellow card for persistent offences.

I cover the scenario of what two do if two offenses occur at the same time at "Advantage" > "Disciplinary Action".

If a goal is scored after the DOGSO offense after playing advantage, then the caution will be shown. I have never seen a professional referee do this - they usually just give no card. (TODO - Video example)
