Whenever an offense occurs, the referee must judge its tactical impact. There are three levels of tactical impact:

- Minimal/None
- Stopping a Promising Attack (SPA)
- Denial of an Obvious Goal Scoring Opportunity (DOGSO)

The level of tactical impact does not depend on intention. A player can unintentionally and not deliberately stop a promising attack or deny an obvious goal scoring opportunity but that does not change the referee's sanction.

Many people will call SPA or DOGSO tactical/professional fouls. Many SPA and DOGSO offenses are tactical/professional fouls but not all. A tactical/professional foul is committed when a player deliberately fouls another but as said above for SPA/DOGSO intention/being deliberate does not matter and SPA/DOGSO apply to any offense (see below).

## SPA

Stopping a Promising Attack is not defined in the Laws of the Game. The referee should use their best judgement. The offense can happen anywhere on the field including a player not allowing the goalkeeper to quickly release the ball.

## DOGSO

> The following must be considered:
> - distance between the offense and the goal
> - general direction of the play
> - likelihood of keeping or gaining control of the ball
> - location and number of defenders
> - Law 12.3 Direct Free Kick

Generally, referees require that all four considerations to be met for DOGSO but it is not a requirement. DOGSO (like offside) is a hard call to make because it requires match officials to look at more than one place at the same time (the spot of the offense, where the defenders are, whether the ball is still playable). DOGSO is often called the last-man foul but DOGSO applies to all offenses (see below) and the considerations above must be met.

## Disciplinary Action

> There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour including if a player:
> - handles the ball to interfere with or stop a promising attack, except where the referee awards a penalty kick for a non-deliberate handball offence
> - denies the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick for a non-deliberate handball offence
> - commits any other offence which interferes with or stops a promising attack, except where the referee awards a penalty kick for an offence which was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball
> - denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by committing an offence which was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball and the referee awards a penalty kick
> - handles the ball [...] in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent a goal
> - Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

> A player, substitute or substituted player who commits any of the following offenses is sent off:
> - denying the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by committing a deliberate handball offence (except a goalkeeper within their penalty area)
> - denying the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by committing a non-deliberate handball offence outside their own penalty area
> - denying a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity to an opponent whose overall movement is towards the offender’s goal by an offence punishable by a free kick (unless as outlined below)
> - Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

Please note that DOGSO applies to "an offense punishable by a free kick". This means that indirect free kick offenses and direct free kick offenses can lead to a red card for DOGSO.

- [The referee should of had the goal kick retaken as the goalkeeper was just setting the ball. Ignoring that, the goalkeeper plays the goal kick twice denying the opponent a clear goal scoring opportunity. Although, the restart is an indirect free kick the offender is sent off.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uivLc9urdBY)
- [Red card for DOGSO doUble touch from a goalkick. ](https://youtu.be/G6w_qGQkrwc?feature=shared)

For DOGSO in the penalty area, assume that the defender is going for the ball unless it is clear that they just wanted to take out the defender. "an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball" can include a charge from the back as long as they were attempting to challenge for the ball.

- [This is not a DOGSO situation. Although this was a charge from the back, this is a challenge for the ball. The defender had an open path to the ball but the attacker fairly moves into that path.](https://youtu.be/06lqnmddvKQ?feature=shared&t=961)

## If Advantage is played

> If the referee plays the advantage for an offense for which a caution/sending-off would have been issued had play been stopped, this caution/sending-off must be issued when the ball is next out of play. However, if the offense was denying the opposing team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity the player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour; if the offense was interfering with or stopping a promising attack, the player is not cautioned.
> - Law 12.3 Disciplinary Action

This, like anything else that is not expressly prohibited, does not stop the referee from penalizing a more serious offense that occurs at the same time. Read more about two offenses at once in the [restarts section](/restarts). If a player SPA in the penalty area which was an attempt for the ball (no card) and commits:

- reckless foul. The referee would still show a yellow card for the reckless foul.
- lack of respect of the game - (e.g. blatant holding). The referee would still show a yellow card for lack of respect of the game.
- persistent offenses. The referee would still show a yellow card for persistent offenses.
