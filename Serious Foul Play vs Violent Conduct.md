> Serious foul play
> 
> A tackle or challenge that endangers the safety of an opponent or uses excessive force or brutality must be sanctioned as serious foul play.
> 
> Any player who lunges at an opponent in challenging for the ball from the front, from the side or from behind using one or both legs, with excessive force or endangers the safety of an opponent is guilty of serious foul play.

> Violent conduct
> 
> Violent conduct is when a player uses or attempts to use excessive force or brutality against an opponent when not challenging for the ball, or against a team-mate, team official, match official, spectator or any other person, regardless of whether contact is made.
> 
> In addition, a player who, when not challenging for the ball, deliberately strikes an opponent or any other person on the head or face with the hand or arm, is guilty of violent conduct unless the force used was negligible.

Both serious foul play and violent counduct are both send-off offenses for using excessive force. It is impossible for an offense to be serious foul play and violent conduct at the same time. It can only be one. 

It is violent conduct if:

- no challenge is being made for the ball or

- the offense is not against an opponent 

This distinction matters as competitions generally will suspend players for more games for violent conduct than serious foul play.

There are also offensive or abusive actions, including physichal ones towards another person, that are not violent conduct and don't involve excessive force but should be a send-off. This includes deliberately pulling an opponent's pants down, slapping an opponent's butt, or kissing an opponent - this is covered in the Dissent vs Abuse section.

## Serious Foul Play

[Red Card - Serious Foul Play The person on the red team charges and jumps at with significant force into the white team's player. That would be just a yellow card. What pushes this to a red card is the offender leads shoulder first and with excessive force and the momentum of their entire body into their opponent's head. There was no way for the victim to pull out of the challenge. While the offender did not deliberately want to endanger the safety of an opponent that is what occured.](https://youtu.be/u-y3AiAm2pI?t=269)

[When a player jumps, they take a risk and are responsible for landing without injuring their opponents. The player after jumping lands their foot on the opponent's leg. The player should be sent-off for Serious Foul Play.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQ__f4JG9o)

## Violent Conduct

[Red Card (Violent Conduct) - Deliberately kicking an opponent with non-neglible foce while the ball is not in the field of play is violent conduct. Outside the field, that is assult. How to deal with the push after the kick is subjective. I prefer no card as this is a reasonable reaction to someone who was just deliberately kicked.](https://youtu.be/gnfbhoNlAKw?t=107)

[The player kicks out at the opponent who just fouled him. Although he does not connect, this is violent conduct and a red card should be shown.](https://youtu.be/2NgJxKL3fgU?t=704)

> If a player, while correctly taking a [corner kick or free kick], deliberately kicks the ball at an opponent in order to play the ball again but not in a careless or reckless manner or using excessive force, the referee allows play to continue.
