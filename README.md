# Ways of the Game

The goal of this guide is to connect different concepts from the Laws of the Game that are related. As well, the guide links relevant videos becuase seeing is easier than just reading. The guide is not a replacement for the Laws or reading the Laws, which are simple and short compared to other sports. The Laws are updated yearly so always be current on [changes](/law-changes).

In addition to the Laws of the Game, most matches have [competition rules](https://footballrules.com/about/additional-competition-rules), which include **important** information that affects the game (e.g. which edition of the Laws to use, substitutions, time of halves, use of sin-bins, allowing slide-tackles, games that need a winner, handling match abandonemnt). Match officals must read and understand competition rules before a game. Game(s) suspension for a send-off or accumulating cautions is found in the competition rules, not in the Laws of the Game. [Here is a sample of competiion rules.](https://cdn1.sportngin.com/attachments/document/0146/2001/Tournament_Rules_Template.pdf)
